A 15 year old boy whistling through the corridors of his High School , unaware of his surroundings, suddenly bumped into someone. 

"Sorry!"

A typical clumsy kid. This kid is none other than me , the author himself! 

"Watch your steps you clumsy moron!"
"I am really sorry, it won't happen again."

Yea, yea.
I am not your super great fantastic protagonist, just a random trash. But hey, don't start to judge me yet because I am a science nerd AND a big one at that.
Normal people can't even comprehend the knowledge a nerd has. Well, can't blame them :/ I mean , it's not like it's their fault that they were born stupid. (i hope u don't drop my novel)

Wait
WAIT WAIT WAIT 
How can someone be so stuuuuupid! I haven't told you my name yet!!!

Well.... Let me tell you! The name of the supreme genius writing this spectacular stor-

"Hey, 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹! Where the hell have you been? I have been looking for you all around the school." 

Wha-? What's wrong with people, first bumping into me (which happened the exact opposite) and now spoiling my mood! I might just throw this novel to a trash can before even completing the first chapter! Well, Apologies for my not-so-elegant behaviour. As you read above, My name's 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳 𝘞𝘪𝘭𝘭𝘪𝘢𝘮𝘴(at least in this story), a teenager studying in the 2nd year of Rosemary Senior High, Florida. You can call me 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹 for short.
This guy who interrupted me is 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘚𝘮𝘪𝘵𝘩, my best friend or you could say the only one I have got... Since I am clumsy and not so social.

𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 is really great at cooking. His father is French so he is a half French with brown hairs and brown eyes.
Me? I am just a plain guy. 
His father has won many prizes in food making competitions in France. So, the blood of a Master Chef runs through his veins(and arteries too).

We both are in the same class. Our school was founded in 1919 and it has become one of the best high schools in all of the North American Continent. There are even people from Canada and Mexico who come here to study. Getting admission in here is hard as hell, even I barely passed the Entrance Exams.

"Hey, 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳. You were looking for me???"

"Yes, you. Have you checked the results of the exam? She is again at the top! And you are just behind her."

"Huh? 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦? That little twig? She scored the highest again? THIS CANNOT BE POSSIBLE!!!"

"It is what it is." 

"But I studied twice as hard as the last time!"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 𝘔𝘢𝘳𝘵ì𝘯𝘦𝘻, great granddaughter of 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦𝘮𝘢𝘳𝘺 𝘔𝘢𝘳𝘵ì𝘯𝘦𝘻, the founder of Rosemary Senior High. An academic elite living up to her family's name. Some people even say that she studies 20 hours a day. And then there is me, a random nobody ;-;. No one knows me.
If it wasn't for her, i would have been at the top of the list and everyone would have known me from the start 

"Don't worry, there is always a next time. Plus your grades are at least higher than me, I barely got into the Top 10.", 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 said.

He tried to cheer me. But he clearly failed at that because I was really frustrated. I am trying to defeat Rose since the First Year of Senior High and i am still trying. Despite all of that struggle, I don't even know if that girl knows my existence or not. She always acts so almighty, like she is a God or something. And people are even attracted to her, i mean, what's there to get attracted to? She is just a little twig with little brain (which as per the grades, is larger than mine).

"C'mon Alex! stop being so gloomy. You can't beat her like that. Let's celebrate tonight!"

I relaxingly said "Yeah, you're right. I am just overreacting over some stupid grades. By the way, what was my percentage?"

"Oh , it's 95.45%"

"Nice! And her?"

"99.97%"

0_0 

"NO! HELL NO!" I barked in anger.

*𝑠𝑖𝑔ℎ
"Chill Alex, It's just a difference of.......... 4.52%"

"That's too much of a difference! I ain't got time for some stupid celebration. Just let me finish my project [Smart Eye], then the whole world will know who I am!!"

"How are you going to finish that if you are here in the school?"

"Who said I am going to be here?"

"What do you mean?"

"Nothing. Just take the Chemistry notes in my stead. Your help is really appreciated 𝘔𝘳. 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘚𝘮𝘪𝘵𝘩. See ya later!"

"𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹! Wait! NOT AGAIN!"
And so, the great beginning begins!

2 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟𝑠 𝑎𝑔𝑜,

I don't remember it quite well but the atmosphere was sure as chill.

"We are really sorry to inform you, 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹. Your parents are no more here with us."

Oh yea, it's that time. When my parents died in a plane crash and I was left in this world to rot alone. I had nothing but enough money to study for at least 3 more years
Hearing about the death of his parents,a normal kid would become sad, scared, 𝑇𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑖𝑓𝑖𝑒𝑑. But I felt nothing. This was the first time i questioned myself "Am I heartless?"
Not even a single tear came out of my eye. Did it happened because I was in a shock? Or because I never had feelings for them.......

*𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠

I suddenly opened my eyes and found myself on my chair.
"𝑊𝑎𝑠 𝐼 𝑎𝑠𝑙𝑒𝑒𝑝?" I thought to myself.

*𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠

Ah! My doorbell is ringing. Who could it be? I don't have many visitors or 𝑎𝑛𝑦 visitor. I had an appartment. Two rooms, one bathroom, one small living room and a small kitchen. All the walls painted plain white. My father bought this place years ago.

*𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠

"Wait a sec! I'm coming!"

I stood up from my chair and walked toward the door. I opened the door just to find that no one was there. I looked left and right, no sign of any human being. I was just about to close the door when my sight fell upon a small box. It had a note over it.
𝐹𝑟𝑜𝑚 𝑂𝑙𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑟

𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳? Why would he send me a box in this creepy way. Well, Whatever. I took the box inside my room and opened it. It had a small tube which contained some greeny fluid. This was not the first time 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 sent me something weird.He sent me these weird things every once in a while. He called them his "Unique Recipe". He wants me to taste his every unique recipe and tell him how good or bad are they. Some were really good, but the problem was, only 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑒 were good. Most of them was trash, pure trash. I expected this one to be bad. Without wasting time any time, i drank a little bit of it. The time it touched my tongue, I realized I had just made a mistake.

*𝑎𝑟𝑔ℎ
"what kind of shit is this?Did 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 liquified his socks and sent them to me?"

I put that green tube on the table and drank some water.

I looked upon my phone.
5:30 PM

Man, I was asleep for a really long time. The last thing I remember is that I was working on [Smart Eye]. I guess I fell asleep that time

Oh wait, I haven't told you yet what this [Smart Eye] thing is, have I? Well, Behold the most revolutionary possible invention in the world of Mankind(or that's what i think). Smart Eye is glasses. Glasses powered by Artificial Intelligence which can calculate and analyse literally anything. It can access Internet within seconds. It can even tell what to do, which move to use, in real life combat. 𝑇𝑟𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 to make this thing is not easy even in the slightest. But one day, I will definitely make this thing and tell the world who 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳 𝘞𝘪𝘭𝘭𝘪𝘢𝘮𝘴 is. I am going to make it big. Real big.

[Smart Eye] is almost finished. It has every coding it needs and as a power source, it's currently connected to my laptop. It's a good enough temporary power source, I will think of something permanent and more easy to handle once it is finished. Let's try it.

Ah! I should use this tube for experiment. At least this way, it would have some worth instead of going directly to the bin. I wore the glasses and looked at the tube which 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 sent and said -

𝐴𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑦𝑠𝑒 𝑂𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡

then a pleasant female voice came,
"Collecting data......"
"Processing............."

𝘈𝘧𝘵𝘦𝘳 10 𝘔𝘪𝘯𝘶𝘵𝘦𝘴

hmph. Looks like it's stuck again. I have tried this 364 times and it never goes beyond Processing. I can't find whatever's wrong with this. Everything looks fine to me. I have even changed the algorithm 6 times but it has never worked. Guess i will just reset it and look for the problem-

"Analysis Partially Failed. Object contains unknown element having total chemical energy of 207 Mega Joule. The molecular structure is unique and has never ever seen."
