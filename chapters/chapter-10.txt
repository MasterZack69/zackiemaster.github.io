"Shoot with full power."

"Ok."

*𝒛𝒂𝒑

Lightning came out of my hands, but it was not even enough to power an electric car.

"I think I said full power."

"I am giving it my all."

Since I cannot just fly and destroy a galactic empire, we have been testing my new powers at this old building once again. And this time too, 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 left me alone with this guy.

"You destroyed robots made up of laser-proof and heat-resistant material and now you dare say that this is your full power?"

"I don't know. Things don't feel like how they did back then."

After having some tests; a dozen of tests, we found out that my cells are generating electrical energy by the rate of 20MJ/h, which is like equivalent to a Diesel Powered Generator. This electricity is stored directly inside my cells They stop generating power when a specific amount of energy is stored which means I do not have an infinite amount of power, it can run out and if it does in between a battle, I will be finished in no time.

"Ok, now fly."

We even tested my speed, it was on par with a latest generation fighter jet.

"I don't have good memories of it but here I fly."

I more like floated above the ground, electrical sparks coming out of my legs and hands. 

"Hmm......... Good. Still why can't you fight like you did yesterday?"

"I don't know. Last thing I remember is that a Kezrin grabbed my neck and I was covered in blood, then suddenly power just unleashed from me."

"Things just don't happen suddenly. Try to remember."

"I can't."

"Here, try to charge my phone."

"What?"

*𝒃𝒆𝒆𝒑 *𝒃𝒆𝒆𝒑

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 looked at his phone, 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 sent him a message-

"She says come back to the lab."

"Ok, I will fly you there."

"No. You will not.", He said in a serious tone.

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

We reached the lab, by simply using a cab.

"It would have been so fast if you would just let me fly."

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "That is not happening as long as I am alive."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "So here you two are! or three?"

"Three."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Yeah , yeah. Ok so 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, come with me. I finished it!"

I followed her to a big capsule which contained-

"Amazing! It is perfect! Minimal and simplistic as I loved."

It was a complete black suit, from neck to toe. I wonder which was more black, this suit or a block of  obsidian. It even had a small cool looking eye mask. I walked toward it and the capsule opened. I touched its fabric, it was roughly and grippy. Its  trench coat fell down all the way to the feet.

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "I used the Stacirium from the Kezrin to make a synthetic fibre with rayon. It will keep you safe from low-powered lasers, 900°C of heat and it is as light as a feather. The mask will hide your identity if you ever fought with the Valacyns in public."

I, who never received a gift from anyone except 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳, was astonished.

"Thank you, 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Your Welcome."

"Ok now, 𝘓𝘪𝘷. Pick a random Valacyn Facility."

𝘓𝘪𝘷 : "Venice."

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

So, our destination was Venice, the city which floated on water. Water, remember her?

I was in my appartment, packing for a long journey. We had a boring conversation on how Venice was this far, that far, but in the end, we decided to go there because we couldn't just sit by watching Aliens destroying our planet. 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 said that she can manage the travelling cost using her family power but I needed to do something about school. I told her I will.

"𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 is calling."

𝑷𝒊𝒄𝒌 𝒊𝒕 𝒖𝒑

"𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, I have been hearing some rumours around here-"

"They are true."

"What? Does it mean-"

"Yes, I left school."

I said all the sentences while cutting his. I cannot just say things like that normally.

"What? Why in the world would you do that?"

"Listen 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳, something really exciting happened. I was offered an internship in MasterNet!!!"

"MasterNet? That big tech giant? That's Amazing!!!"

"Yeah, and I was also running low on money so I thought I would just focus on the internship. It has got a good paycheck, free appartment and lots of other things. That's why l left school."

"So that's right......... You are never coming back."

"Well, we will still stay in touch. I am just moving to Virginia. You can call me whenever you want."

"Ok, so when are you leaving?"

"Now, I am the airport currently- Oh my flight is here, I gotta go, bye!"

"Wait wha-"

"Call has ended."

𝑻𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒘𝒂𝒔 𝒕𝒐𝒖𝒈𝒉.

My bag and I, both were ready. It was time to leave The States.

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

We were at the airport. It was night-time. Crescent moon shined over the planes, enlightening their beauty. Countless stars covered the sky. I wish I could see my friend one last time before leaving.

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "You sure you made the right choice?"

"Yes, I am."

We three were sitting on the chairs, waiting for our flight. Our front was big wall, made of glass. We could see all the planes coming and going- or landing and flying.

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Listen 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, I am from a prestigious family. So leaving school for a few days doesn't matter much to me. But you have left it for a lifetime. You career is in danger."

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "It won't matter a bit if we all end up dead."

"Thanks for the motivation."

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Your Welcome."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 sighed.

"Hey, 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦. How are we getting my suit through the security check?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Security Check is for the commercial flights. Not ours."

"What do you mean by that?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "My family has some planes. We are going to use one of them. Oh here it is!"

We all looked towards the runway, there was a small plane, approximately 80 ft. long. It was completely white colored and something written on its left-
𝘔𝘢𝘳𝘵í𝘯𝘦𝘻

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "You know, when I was your age-"

"Yeah when you were our age, you grinded so hard just to make your father purchase a bicycle for you. I know that story."

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "It's not just a story. It's an emotion, something your generation will never understand."

"And I am not even interested to."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "You two coming or not?"

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

The moment I stepped inside the plane, I was charmed by the beautiful aroma and the luxury it offered.

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Make yourselves comfortable."

We all sat on the window seats. The seat was really fluffy. From the window, I gazed outside realising this maybe the last time I am here. Realising, I may never come back. I had a past with plane crash which I could never forget.

𝑰𝒕'𝒔 𝒉𝒂𝒑𝒑𝒆𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈, 𝑰 𝒂𝒎 𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒗𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒎𝒚 𝒄𝒐𝒖𝒏𝒕𝒓𝒚.

The engine started humming and with that, my heart started pounding. Our rythms matched each other. The plane started moving forward. I was feeling something which I couldn't explain. And then, the plane started flying, up above the land so high. It was my first flight and it was beautiful. From my window, I gazed upon the city which was twinkling in the night.

After 5 hours of netfl-
I mean after 5 hours of flight, we were flying above the middle of Atlantic Ocean. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 was eating some ice-cream. 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦, she was just sleeping. She looked kinda cute but that was a story for another time. I looked out from the window, there was only ocean to be seen. There were not much clouds either. I wonder what would happen if 𝘕𝘦𝘳𝘰𝘷𝘢𝘯𝘯 attacks me here. Let's just hope no-

Captain over the radio : "Ms. 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦, can you come here?"

She was sleeping, giving no response. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 and I looked at each other and then-

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "She is currently sleeping."

"Everything all right?" (things are never right whenever you ask this kind of question)

Captain : "Ok you two, come here."

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

There was a dot on the radar, blinking at the same position.

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Are we safe?"

Captain : "For now we are. They do not seem to be responding to our signals. It looks like they are flying right above us for 15 minutes straight. For some reason, we cannot get an ID on what kind of aircraft is that."

I glanced at 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯, telling him to come outside. He followed me to outside the cockpit.

"You think it's them?"

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "They could be, but they should have attacked by now. Maybe they are just som-"

*𝒑𝒆𝒘

The plane just took a sharp turn to left. I and 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 fell down. 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 had a seatbelt, so she was fine. She slightly opened her eyes, giving me a look of confusion.

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Did you blow something off?"

"No! Why would I do something like that!", I said while getting myself back on the feets.

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "You always seem to enjoy your powers."

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "We do not have time for this chit chat. Captain! what happened!?"

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 also got on his feets, his hairs were curly now.

Captain : "The aircraft above us just fired!"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "What!? There is an aircraft above us? Why I wasn't told anything?"

"Because you were sleeping, thought I would not disturb you."

Captain : "They are coming down."

*𝒑𝒆𝒘

The plane took another sharp turn, this one was rightward. I fell toward a window. There in the presence of moonlight- I saw something.

"Hey 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦, does this plane have weapons?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "No, this is not a military jet."

"You wish it was."

What I saw was an aircraft, not just any. It was of a design no one had ever seen. It was half the size of our plane, but it looked dangerous. The meaning was clear.

Captain : "There is an aircraft right beside us!"

*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘

It started showering us with lasers, but thankfully our Captain was skilled. He moved the plane so fluidly, dodging every hit.

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹! Is that?"

"That's a Valacyn spaceship for sure."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "What? How did they know about us being here?"

"That doesn't matter, we have to do something. Should I go out and take care of that ship?"

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "No! You are not ready yet. Even if you fly perfectly, how are you going to defeat them? You cannot control your powers completely."

"What other option do we have? At this rate, we will just die in this middle of nowhere! 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦, get me my suit."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Are you for real?"

"Please! Have a little bit of trust in me!"

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Let him have his way. He is right, we are out of options."

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

Wearing my suit, I jumped out from the plane through the emergency exit. I was falling downward the ocean with high speed.

𝑳𝒊𝒗, 𝒍𝒆𝒕'𝒔 𝒏𝒐𝒕 𝒅𝒊𝒔𝒂𝒑𝒑𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒕 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒎.

Lightning sparks came from my hands and legs and then- My direction was changed, I was no longer going downward, I was now going in the exact opposite direction. I could see the Valacyn aircraft-

𝑨𝒏𝒂𝒍𝒚𝒛𝒆

"Analysis Completed. Object identifies to be a Valacyn  Starfigther. There are 2 Valacyns inside."

𝑫𝒐𝒆𝒔 𝒊𝒕 𝒉𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝒕𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒎𝒊𝒔𝒔𝒊𝒍𝒆𝒔?

"No."

𝑮𝒐𝒐𝒅. 

I felt a sense of confidence. I knew I could dodge everything as long as it didn't trace me. I flew right to the star fighter. I came near it and asked them to leave in the nicest way possible-

"Get the fuck out of here you useless pieces of shit!"

It seemed like they weren't as nice as me. They turned towards me-

*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘

I dodged every laser bolt, moving forward and then I raised my hand toward them- 

*𝒛𝒂𝒑 

A lightning bolt came out of my hand, striking to the star fighter. It did just some damage, but the problem was that it only did "some".

𝑳𝒐𝒐𝒌𝒔 𝒍𝒊𝒌𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒚 𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝒏𝒐𝒕 𝒈𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒕𝒐 𝒎𝒂𝒌𝒆 𝒊𝒕 𝒆𝒂𝒔𝒚.

I flew down, right to the ocean. They did too. I was almost at the water level, I flew right above it, dodging their lasers. They were a little above me, firing with no mercy. All of their attacks were futile, hitting the ocean with no target.

Then I flew high and they followed me, their lasers too.

*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘

The air was chilling. I took a crescent turn-

*𝒛𝒂𝒑

They dodged my lightning bolt and returned fire. I dodged too. I flew right towards them and they did the same. They were ruthlessly attacking me with lasers, but I dodged them like they were nothing. The gap between us was lessening and then- I stopped my powers, falling down the ocean. The Starfigther came to be right above me. From below, I activated my powers once again and started flying and raised both my hands towards the Starfigther and-

*𝒛𝒂𝒑

A huge bolt of lightning pierced right through the enemy craft. It broke down in 2 pieces, falling into the ocean.
