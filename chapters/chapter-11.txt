Captain : "Wh-who are you?"

After beating the hell out of that Valacyn Starfigther, I came back inside the plane where our captain had a simple but hard to answer question.

"Good question. I'm 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹 and......."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Captain, let's go to your cockpit. You and I can have a chat there."

𝑻𝒉𝒂𝒏𝒌 𝒚𝒐𝒖, 𝑹𝒐𝒔𝒆.

Captain : "Alright."

She and the Captain were then gone to the cockpit. Which basically meant that I was alone again with him.

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "You planning on wearing this suit for the rest of your life? Go change."

"You know you could've praised me. I just brought down a spaceship."

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "So what? The Valacyns must have thousands of them, maybe even millions. Killing one or two doesn't make a difference. If you want your praise, go kill the Emperor."

"Yeah, yeah."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "That was hard."

She came back from the cockpit, giving both of us a familiar look.

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Were you two........."

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "No, we were not fighting. How did things go with the captain?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Oh yeah, it went fine. I basically told him every single thing there was to know about. He agreed to keep this between us."

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "He believed alien Invasion and all?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Yes, he did. After all, it was me talking to him."

"So we are good to go. I will go sleep then."

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "First take off your suit."

"Don't need a reminder."

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

"𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, wake up."

"Let me sleep a bit more."

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Wake the fuck up."

I suddenly opened my eyes, finding our doctor right in front of me. 

"Can you please stay away a bit?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "We are here, 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹. Venice."

Hearing her, I looked out of my window. What I saw was a foreign land where I have never been to. What I felt was the big change that had came to my life. What I wanted to do was to go back to my normal life? Fuck that, I am here to kick some ass!

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Go wash your face. We are landing in an hour."

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

Captain on comms : "Everyone get your seatbelts. We are landing in 5.... 4.... 3..... 2..... 1."

As the number reached 1, the plane started going slightly downwards. Not just the plane, my heartbeat also started going down, giving me an uneasy feeling. 

𝑭𝒊𝒏𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒚 𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒆.

The plane touched the ground, its wheels slowing down. Then, they finally stopped moving. The Gates opened, stairs showing themselves, telling me it's time to go.

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Let's go."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 didn't look nervous, not even a bit. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯, well, he looked like 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯. It seemed that I was overthinking this whole situation. Kezrin, Spaceship, I have beaten them all. There should be nothing here that could challenge me.

After 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 and 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯, I was the last one to get off the plane. The moment I stepped outside, my eyes reacted to the bright sunlight. My nose reacting to the fresh european air. My ears, they remained undisturbed. The runway was quite silent.

𝑳𝒊𝒗, 𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒆.
2:00 PM

I followed them both to the main area of Airport. The airport was filled with thousands of light even in broad daylight. All of the boards had written one line in them-

"Welcome to Venice."

We walked towards the exit. Outside the airport, there was a black Mercedes, its driver stepped out and looked towards us- or her.

Driver : "𝘔𝘴. 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦! How was your flight?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "It was good. How gentle of you to ask. Meet my friends, 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹 and 𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯."

Driver : "It is nice to meet you all. Come, lets get to your lodging."

We put our luggages in the back. I moved toward the seat next to the driver-

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Hey, hey, hey. You go sit in the back seat. This area is reserved for the adults."

He said while pushing me aside and seating himself in. I just gave a sigh and sat on the back, next to 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦. The car's  engine was lit up, its wheel started rolling. 

Driver : "So, how are things in USA?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Things are just great. 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹 here is my self-proclaimed rival from school who has never beaten me once is studies."

"Wait, what?", I said while giving her a confused look.

Driver : "That sounds great."

"𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦, I don't remember telling you about this rivalry thing."

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "You don't need to. It's written all over your face."

"Huh?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "He is right. You don't need to hide it. Just try hard and beat me once."

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Considering you are never going to beat her."

"Huh, huh?"

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

After some time, we reached our destination. I and 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 were confused actually.

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Weren't we supposed to go to our lodging?"

Driver : "Yeah and this here is your lodging, sir."

What in front of us was a big Mansion. Big enough like 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦's home in Florida.

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "What are we waiting for? Let's get inside." 

I stepped out of the car, and so did 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 and 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦. We got our luggages out too. The car then left, leaving the three of us alone.

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "You mind explaining?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Well, We cannot just use a hotel room for our operations. It is one of the 𝘔𝘢𝘳𝘵í𝘯𝘦𝘻 family's house for international business trips."

"One of how many?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "I don't keep a count but probably 50 or something."

𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕? 𝑳𝒊𝒗 𝒉𝒐𝒘 𝒎𝒂𝒏𝒚 𝒉𝒐𝒖𝒔𝒆𝒔 𝒅𝒐𝒆𝒔 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝑴𝒂𝒓𝒕í𝒏𝒆𝒛 𝒇𝒂𝒎𝒊𝒍𝒚 𝒉𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝒐𝒗𝒆𝒓 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒍𝒅?

𝘓𝘪𝘷 : "The 𝘔𝘢𝘳𝘵í𝘯𝘦𝘻 family have total 165 residencies in all over the world."

"Hey, hey. 𝘓𝘪𝘷 tells me that your family own 165 houses!"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Maybe I miscalculated?"

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Yes, a very small miscalculation."

After having a small chat, we moved towards her "one of the home". 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 got to the door. The door's skeletal structure was made of metal and the rest was glass. It had suprisingly no keyhole or anything to put even a keycard. She then put her thumb to the handle-

"Access granted. Welcome 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 𝘔𝘢𝘳𝘵í𝘯𝘦𝘻."

This voice which came from the door, was followed by the light bulbs turning on which we could see through the door's transparent body. She then opened the door. She stepped inside first, then I followed her. I was stunned by seeing the luxury in front me. It was so huge. The staircase to the upper floor was complete glass. I could see the white sofa having a borderline color of gold. Even the table was glass. 

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Nice house you have."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Thank you. Your room is just right to the stairs at upper floor. 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, yours is right next to him. "

"Is that necessary?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "I beg your pardon?"

"Never mind. I can manage." 

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "So do you have a plan?"

"Yeah, a rather simple one actually."

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

I was walking a street, wearing my suit, hiding my identity. There was a floating market right beside me. I could see beautiful colorful buildings. Some were red, some were blue. It was certainly a beautiful evening, it's a shame that I am going to destroy such beauty.

𝑳𝒊𝒗, 𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒆.
6:35 PM

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 and 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 were operating from home. We were in touch through communications. I was in the place which was supposed to have a Valacyn Facility somewhere but there was no exact location and this place was no small. Some people were even staring at me- or my suit, can't blame them.

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "So what are you planning to do?"

"As I said before, it's very simple. I am just going to invite them to me."

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Huh?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Don't you think it's risky?"

"What's risky? This is the first time I am hearing about such a word."

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Whatever you do, just don't attract much attention."

"Well, that's inevitable."

I raised my right hand towards the sky-

*𝒛𝒂𝒑

A huge bolt of lightning was shot in the sky. Its sound pierced the atmosphere. Reacting to that, the whole market looked towards me. Every seller stopped selling, every buyer stopped buying. They all did the same, looking at me with confusion.

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, what did you do?"

"Nothing, I just gained some popularity."

She sighed. I took a deep breath and then, looking at the people who were staring at me, I shouted-

"LISTEN YOU FUCKING VALACYNS! I know you are hearing this, one day, I am going to destroy every single of you and your home planet. If you chickens have guts then come at me and we can finish this right here, right now. It's not necessary for you to come. I mean, who would like to get their ass kicked by a 15 year old?"

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "YOU STUPID!!!! You realize what you have done!?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "You cannot just openly provoke them in public! No one would be stupid enough to fall for that."

"I know what I am doing. I have talked with these Valacyns before, first a mad scientist and then that stupid emperor. If any Valacyn here has the same short temper as them, they will surely react."

Random Person from Crowd : "Dovrebbe essere una specie di dramma?" (in Italian)
*Is it supposed to be some kind of drama? (the translation)

"What?"

Random 2 : "Chiamo la polizia."
*I am calling the police.

"Wait no, no ,no."

No Valacyn gave a response to my message, considering if there was even one.

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "I think you just messed up pretty bad there."

Random 3 : "Vai fuori di qui! Stai distruggendo i nostri affari!"
*Get out of here! You are destroying our business!

"But 𝘓𝘪𝘷 told me that there was a 9% chance that it would wor-"

*𝒑𝒆𝒘

A laser bolt came right at me, I dodged it by ducking down.

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹?"

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "What happened?"

"Shit happened."

I saw some people, wearing purple suits. 9 of them. They came out of the crowd and pointed their guns at me. There was just a huge wall at my back. In the front, aliens thirsty for my blood. Basically, I was pinned- or that's what these aliens thought. They all at once started firing-

*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘

I flew high, to the sky. Their lasers just touched the bare wall. Seeing that, the common folks started running for their lives. From up above, I shooted the one at the center with Lightning. He fell down in the water.

𝑶𝒏𝒆 𝒅𝒐𝒘𝒏. 𝑬𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕 𝒍𝒆𝒇𝒕.

I held back so he will probably be alive. I could defeat all of them just like that. But there is no fun in that. I jumped down, to a small boat which luckily had no one aboard. It unbalanced a little, but then it was fine.

"Does any of you know where 𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘻𝘭𝘢𝘳 is?", I politely asked.

"Be ready to die!", someone politely answered.

*𝒛𝒂𝒑

I politely electrocuted him.

"I will take that as a no."

They all fired at me. I jumped from this boat to another giving another lightning bolt to someone. 

𝑺𝒊𝒙 𝒎𝒐𝒓𝒆.

I jumped right in front of one of them, gave him a punch to his stomach. He fell down on his knees and then I swinged my leg to his face- Poor guy, it must have hurt like hell.

*𝒑𝒆𝒘

A laser had hitten me, more like my suit. But the Stacirium Fibre was no joke, it actually was laser proof.

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 :  "𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, you copy?"

"The person you are trying to contact is busy fighting aliens. Please try again later."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Damn You!"

I picked up the gun of the guy whose face I just kicked and used it to attack the guy who just shot me.

*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘*𝒑𝒆𝒘

Taking the hit, he fell down in the water. 4 more were standing. One of them was right straight to me in a distance. I ran towards him. He started firing at me, but it was futile.

*𝒔𝒎𝒂𝒔𝒉 

My lightning punch smashed his face. Maybe it broke a teeth or two, who knows. One of the last three came at me with a metal knife probably 6-inch long.

𝑳𝒐𝒐𝒌𝒔 𝒍𝒊𝒌𝒆 𝒔𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒐𝒏𝒆 𝒉𝒂𝒔 𝒃𝒓𝒂𝒊𝒏.

He raised his hand to attack me, but we very well know what happened the last time someone used a knife against me. I gave that guy a lightning kick to his stomach which sent him flying to the other two. 

"All down."

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "That was too easy."

"Or maybe I was just too strong."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "You got any info from them?"

"They didn't seem to give any." 

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Ok for now, come back. Mission Venice completed. The Italian police will surely look at the Valacyns."

"Ok the-"

*𝒕𝒉𝒖𝒅

Something dropped upon me. Something heavy. I fell down just to take a look at a familiar face.

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Hey, 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹. You all right?"

"Guys, we have an old friend."

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Who?"

"The Kezrin."

He was standing, straight and silent in front of me. I remained lied on the ground. Suddenly his right hand just transformed into a blade.

"Woah, Woah."

Without wasting any time, I raised my hands gave him a full power lightning bolt.

*𝒛𝒂𝒑

He fell a high distance away, but, he got back on his feet again.

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "What's happening?"

"I am having coffee with that robot. What kind of question is that, of course I am fighting him. Could you just sit back for a minute?"

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "How many are there?"

"Only One. He looks dangerous. I gave him a full power lightning bolt but it doesn't seem to have done much damage. Looks like I will have to take care of this one by close combat."

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Wait, try flying him up and then throw him down when you have reached enough height."

"Oh yeah, good idea. Looks like you are not so useless after all."

𝘓𝘪𝘷 : "It is not possible as the Kezrins can fly."

"Oh wow, Looks like you 𝒂𝒓𝒆 actually useless."

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "You come back here and I will thermal decompose your body."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, you mind taking care of the business there?"

"Alright. Come at me, you Kezrin."

Given my invitation, he ran toward me and I did the same. I first tried to hit him with another lightning bolt but he used his blade-like hand to block it.

𝑯𝒆 𝒄𝒂𝒏 𝒅𝒐 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒕𝒐𝒐?

The gap between us vanished as he used the blade to sweep attack me, I ducked down, sweep kicking both of his legs in hope that he may fall down. But it didn't happen. What happened was me getting kicked in my face and falling badly.

*𝒂𝒓𝒈𝒉

"Fuck, that hurt."

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "We have got other facilities to destroy. Can you hurry up with this one?"

"I'm trying!"

I got back on my feet. I grabbed the Kezrin's blade-like hand with my one hand and used the other to punch him in his face but he grabbed it with his other hand. So, I used my leg to give him the history's strongest lightning kick. He moved back a bit but it didn't end there, I used both my hands to shoot at him recklessly again and again, countless times. 

"Die, die, die!"

*𝒕𝒉𝒖𝒅 

Finally he fell. He was in, let's say, a rough condition. I mean very rough. Maybe even beyond that. Let's not get into the horrible details.

"It's finished."

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Took you a long time. Now come back before any policemen catches you."

"Yes. yes."

*𝒄𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒌𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒗𝒐𝒊𝒄𝒆

"Did you say something?"

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "What?"

*𝒄𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒌𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒗𝒐𝒊𝒄𝒆

Unknown Voice : "H-hello."

"Holy Shit! The Kezrin is talking!"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "What?"

*𝒄𝒓𝒂𝒄𝒌𝒍𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒗𝒐𝒊𝒄𝒆 

Unknown Voice : "Hello. Can you hear me?"

"Yes, I can."

Unknown Voice : "Great. It's good to finally have a chat with you, 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹. I'm 𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘻𝘭𝘢𝘳. I think 𝘕𝘦𝘳𝘰𝘷𝘢𝘯𝘯 must have told you about me."

"Wait, wait. You are that mad scientist experimenting your stupid project on my planet?"

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘻𝘭𝘢𝘳 : "Yes, yes. That would be me. What is with this stupid project? I thought as a Man of Science and someone who knows the power of Kezlar, you would appreciate my project. After all they gave you powers didn't they?"

"The power which got me nearly killed many times. The one responsible for me leaving my country, fighting against a galactic empire with actually no practical support. Yeah, very helpful they are."

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘻𝘭𝘢𝘳 : "Looks like you do not know how to appreciate a gift."

"Why not meet face to face. I will tell you how much appreciation I have for you and your gift."

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘻𝘭𝘢𝘳 : "We will surely meet one day. For now, I should go back to my work. Nice meeting you."

"Wait! I still have a dozen questions!"

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘻𝘭𝘢𝘳 : "If you so desperately want answers, come to Kyoto."

"Wait! where in Kyoto? It's a big damn place."

No reply came.

"Hey!"

*𝒔𝒊𝒓𝒆𝒏

I looked around, some police were approaching near. 

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹! Hurry up!"

"Fuck!"
