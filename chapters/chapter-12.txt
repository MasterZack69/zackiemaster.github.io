On the TV screen-
         "Saved by The Light"

"What the fuck?"

It was 8:00 PM at night. After receiving an invitation to Japan, I came back just to find these weird things on TV.

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Looks like you have become quite a hero."

"But I do not remember doing any heroic thing, I just kicked aliens! Why the hell are they treating me like a hero?"

Reporter on TV : "Potrebbe descriverci la situazione?"
*Could you please describe us the situation?

Person 1 : "Stavo solo facendo i miei affari quotidiani e all'improvviso sono apparse queste persone in abito viola! Hanno cercato di uccidermi ma è arrivato un altro ragazzo vestito di nero. Un fulmine uscì dalle sue mani e colpì quei malvagi abiti viola. Mi ha salvato!"

*I was just doing my daily business and suddenly these people in purple suit appeared! They tried to kill me but another guy in black suit came. Lightning came out of his hands and struck those evil purple suits. He saved me! 

𝘓𝘪𝘷 was translating all the words through the laptop's speaker.

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "That was very heroic."

"Hey! I remember now! That guy was the one who was telling me to get the hell out of there!"

Person 2 : "Quei malvagi vestiti viola mi sono saltati addosso ma poi quel ragazzo ha preso a calci anche loro! È un vero eroe!"

*Those evil purple suits jumped at me but then that guy kicked them too! He is a literal hero!

"Hey! That guy was the one who was saying that he will call the police! I understand everything now, these people, they are just using my name to get their faces on tv!"

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "At least you are gaining some popularity for saving earth from Alien Invasion."

"That's okay but what's this with the light???? Couldn't they find a better name? Like Sparky or something. Light is just plain lame! I deserve a better name! Isn't that right, 𝘓𝘪𝘷?"

𝘓𝘪𝘷 : "The Light is actually a good name. It's out of the mainstream and unique. Also Sparky sounds like a dog's name."

"Not you too!"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Oh hey look! This is coming up on the international news too! Everyone's talking about you!"

"FUCK THIS!"

In frustration, I left the living room and came at terrace. It was.... cold. 

𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕'𝒔 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒕𝒆𝒎𝒑𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒖𝒓𝒆?
18°C

It was currently spring in Venice. The temperature at this season here varies from 15°C to 25°C. I could feel the cold wind blowing in the air. As it touched my skin, it left a sensation of chill.

"𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 is calling."

It felt like it had been years since I last heard this.

𝑷𝒊𝒄𝒌 𝒊𝒕 𝒖𝒑.

"Hey!"

"Hey, Hey!"

"𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹! You finish with the lunch?"

I was just going to ask what did he mean by that but then I remembered about the time difference between USA and Italy.

"Oh yea, I had some fried rice for lunch."

"Fried rice for lunch? Looks like leaving florida has made you even weirder than you were before."

"Ok so what did you had for lunch, Master Chef?"

"I had Quiche Lorraine."

"Qui the what?"

"In simple words, It is a French pie."

"Oh, you should have just said pie."

"It would have sound boring. So how are things going with the internship?"

"Oh they are actually cool. There is just one nuisance."

"Nuisance?"

"Yeah this guy 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯, another intern here, he is so cocky. He cannot even do one thing properly and when I do it, he acts so almighty like how it could be done in a better way. He's such a pain in the ass. I might even kill him before this internship ends!"

"Oh well............. that sounds fun."

"Whatever, how are things there?"

"Oh, right. You know the same day you left, 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 left for some historical research. I think she is somewhere in Europe."

"She did? Damn, rich students nowadays are going anywhere to study."

*𝒂𝒉𝒆𝒎

I turned around to see 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 standing, looking at me.

"𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, What was that?"

"Nothing, it seems my supervisor has found me wasting time. I will call you later."

"Ok, bye."

The call hung up. Then, I looked toward her.

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Looks like you were enjoying your chat."

"And looks like you were enjoying spying."

"I am just here to tell you that we got to talk."

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

We all were in the living room, sitting around the table. The atmosphere was heavy enough to trample anyone. 

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "So it looks like it is going to be pretty clear what are we going to do."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Yeah, but what if it's a trap. Even if it is not, that is the head facility we are talking about. There must be dozens of Kezrin there. And that doctor, we do not what he can do. 𝘕𝘦𝘳𝘰𝘷𝘢𝘯𝘯's secrecy is also a big concern."

"Either way, we do not have much choice, destroying all of the Valacyn facilities will take a whole amount of time. Who knows, if they are still experimenting on humans. We cannot afford more time."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "So we are going, huh? To Kyoto."

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 picked up a gun from one of his pocket of the coat. He gave a serious look.

𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Yeah we are, fully locked and loaded."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Ok, I will tell the pilot to come at the airport tomorrow morning."
