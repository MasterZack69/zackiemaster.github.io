"Analysis Partially Failed. Object contains unknown element having total chemical energy of 207 Mega Joule. The molecular structure is unique and has never ever seen."

"WHAT THE FUCK!"

I mean, my project is finally completed now and I should be really happy and proud but what the hell? Unknown Element? 207 Mega Joule? Unique Molecular Structure? And I consumed that fucking thing???????
207 Mega Joule is like 4 times  the amount of chemical energy present in the bonds of 1 Litre Petrol and this green fluid was like only 50ml. The fuck did I just consume! My heart was racing like crazy, 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 crazy. I'm not going to die, am I? Breathing was becoming hard moment by moment.

After 5 minutes,

"Analysis Completed. 
  Subject is completely fine. 
  Heart Rate : 96 bpm
  No disease or disorder found.
  Life Processes are normal"

"Hell yeah....... good..... to know......" I said catching my breath.

Everything was fine except my little high heart rate which was because of me panicking. Looks like this green fluid is safe to use but how the hell did 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 get his hands on something like this and why would he sent this to me without even an explanation.

I picked up my phone and was about to call him but then.................

𝑊ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑖𝑓 𝐼 𝑢𝑠𝑒 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑓𝑙𝑢𝑖𝑑 𝑡𝑜 𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑢𝑝 [𝑆𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑡 𝐸𝑦𝑒].......

If I use this as the power source, not will it be just very convenient and efficient, but it will power [Smart Eye] enough for a whole month. I will just ask 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 for more of it, then it will be ready for mass manufacture and then my golden days will begin!
I took the glasses off my face, grabbed some tools, did some adjustments here and there, put that tube filled with green liquid. After half an hour, it was ready to use.

Once again, I wore the glasses, looked at my laptop and said -

"Collecting data......"

Then after some mere seconds,

"Analysis Completed. Object identifies as a Laptop manufactured by MasterNet, Master A15 Nvdia Edition.
Intel i7 13th Gen P Series, Nvidia RTX 3060ti, 16GB DDR4X RAM, 1TB Gen 3 SSD. Exterior made up of Polycarbonate.
Available to purchase on MasterNet.com, would you like me to redirect you to the website?"

"Hell yeah!" I exclaimed.

The analysis which used to take too much time was now being completed in mere seconds. My project was now going to change the whole world! I couldn't control my excitement. I couldn't wait to tell 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳. I looked at my water bottle and said it again-

"Collecting data......"
"Processing............."

"Analysis Completed. Object identifies as a plastic bottle filled with water. Water inside contains some impurities. Purification suggested.

and then again 
"Hell yeah!" 

In excitement, I looked at my table-

"Analysis Completed. Object identifies as a Screwdriver made up of Steel.

I heard the sound of lightning and looked out of my window. The atmosphere was nowhere nice. It was dark, no trace of light. Looked like it was going to rain. A normal person would not care much about something like this, but a nerd like me who just made a brilliant Nobel-Prize-winning capable invention is definitely going to. It was a really good time to use the [Smart Eye] to analyze atmosphere conditions.

I left my room in a hurry, didn't even care to close the door and reached the terrace. Wind was blowing fast, real fast. I then looked above at the sky and chanted the magical but scientific words-

𝐴𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑦𝑠𝑒 𝐴𝑡𝑚𝑜𝑠𝑝ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒

"Collecting data......"
"Processing............."

After a mere second it came 
"Analysis Completed. The Weather is likely to be a thunderstorm.
Wind Speed : 22km/h
Humidity : 15g/m³
Air Pressure : 980 hPa
Precipitation Chance : 94%
Highly advised to stay indoors. "

"woohooooooooo"

I looked at a part where the lightning strikes were dancing.

𝐶𝑎𝑙𝑐𝑢𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝐶𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡

"Collecting data......"
"Processing............."

"Calculation Completed. Each lightning bolt contains an electric current of 35000-50000 Ampere."

In happiness, I exclaimed, "I have done it! I finally have!" 

and then in a moment-
