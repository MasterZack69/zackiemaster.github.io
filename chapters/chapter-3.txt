*𝐿𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝐹𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔 

 "@j&₹!"
 "$¢@¶&!"
 
I heard some words, but I was incapable of understanding them. I wasn't feeling anything much. One thing I did feel, that I was weak.

*𝐿𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝐹𝑙𝑖𝑐𝑘𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔 

It was all dark, a light bulb glowing and dimming.

"𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹! 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹!"

I opened my eyes, seeing a familiar face.......

"𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳?" I asked in my weak voice.

"𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, thank God you are alive!"

I moved my head a little bit and found myself on a bed. It looked like a hospital. There was a man in white coat.

He took a look at me and said,"Don't move too much, kid. You are lucky that you are even alive, only a few injuries, nothing much serious."

"Ok, doctor."
My voice was still weak.

𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 asked the doctor, "How much time will it take him to recover?".

"Well, he is recovering fast. I guess he can be discharged within......... a day."

"Thank You."

"Your Welcome, I think I will go see my other patients then."

Then the doctor left. 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 and I were left alone in the room. I tried to think what happened but I couldn't remember anything beside that I was testing [Smart Eye].

"𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳, What happened to me?" 

"What happened to 𝑦𝑜𝑢, you ask?, You were struck by a fucking lightning bolt! Don't you remember?"

"No, I don't. Wait, a lightning bolt!?"

"Yes, a lightning bolt."

"How in the world did that happen?"

"Yesterday, weather was bad, really bad. A lightning bolt struck on the building of your appartment. Your neighbour found you there after that. We thought you were gone........"

"Sorry for making you worry......" My voice still weak.
"What happened to my belongings?" I asked.

"Well, your clothes were practically burnt, your phone blasted. Your appartment is at least safe."

"And my glasses?"

"What glasses?"

"The [Smart Eye]."

"As far as I know, it wasn't anywhere to be found."

It wasn't there? Then where it was? What happened to it? Was it destructed by the lightning bolt? Did someone stole my invention? I had many questions but no answer.

"and that green fluid you sent me?"

"Green fluid? Now what's that? Some kinda new sauce?"

"Stop joking. 𝑇ℎ𝑎𝑡 green fluid, the one you sent me yesterday in a small tube."

"Wait, wait ,wait. I never sent you anything like that. Looks the lightning has made you crazy."

"I am not crazy!" I said in frustration 

"𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, I think, instead of asking questions, you should take a rest. I will go and give you some air."

Then 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 left.

Ah, man! Why the fuck did something unfortunate like that happened! Whenever it looks like my life is going good, it takes turn for worse. I finished my ultimate project and now it was gone. Completely gone. And if it wasn't 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳, then who sent me that weird thing. I looked above at the ceiling, with sadness. 


"𝑇ℎ𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠 𝑤𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑑 ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑒 𝑏𝑒𝑒𝑛 𝑒𝑎𝑠𝑦 𝑖𝑓 𝐼 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑑 𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡 𝑠𝑜𝑙𝑣𝑒 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑠 𝑚𝑦𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑦 𝑏𝑦 𝑠𝑎𝑦𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝐴𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑦𝑧𝑒" I thought.

Then, I heard a voice in my head-

"Collecting data......"
"Processing............."

"𝑊ℎ𝑎𝑡?" I thought to myself.

Then again in my head, a voice came-
"Analysis Completed. Object identifies as a ceiling of a building. Made up of Concrete, painted white. Traces of Palster of Paris found."

"𝑊ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑡ℎ𝑒 ℎ𝑒𝑙𝑙? 𝐷𝑖𝑑 𝑖 𝑏𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 𝑎 𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑜𝑡?"

I looked at the light bulb and thought in my mind, 𝐴𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑦𝑧𝑒 𝑂𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡

"Collecting data......"
"Processing............."

"Analysis Completed. Object identifies as an 60W Electric Bulb. Producing 850 Lumens of light."

Woah, woah. This cannot be, This is impossible! This is life not a fantasy where the main character gets power like this.
Somehow, the [Smart Eye] is inside me now. BUT HOW!!!!

And then, another weird thing happened. I felt a surge of energy in my body. I got off the bed and moved my body a bit. Moments ago, I was weak as hell and now this.

𝐴𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑦𝑧𝑒 𝑚𝑦 𝑏𝑜𝑑𝑦 

"Collecting data......"
"Processing............."

"Analysis Completed. Subject is abnormal. High amount of electrical energy found. Life Processes are 30% faster than normal."

What? High amount of electrical energy in my body? how am I even alive?

𝑅𝑜𝑜𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝐴𝑏𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦

"Analysis Failed. Cannot find the source of abnormality in Subject's body."

There is something that [Smart Eye] cannot analyze? I really need to solve this mystery. I rushed out of my room and reached the doctor.

"Doctor! Look! I am completely fine. I think I can go now."

C'mon, I am definitely not letting him know about my 𝑝𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟. What if he is some evil doctor who sells his patients' organ for money. What if he makes me a lab rat or sell me to someone bad. 

"Are you sure, 𝘔𝘳. 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹?. You really need a rest."

I took a flower pot and threw it upward. Then when it was coming down, I caught it.

"See? I am full of energy!"

"That was a risky demonstration, but I think you are really fine. You are free to go."

"Thanks for treating to me!" I said letting my hands go off the flower pot. It fell on the marbalic floor and shattered in numerous pieces. The sound of its crackling echoed like a gunshot.

"I will add an extra 60$ to your bill."

"Sorry.............."







(60$ for a fucking pot? I told you he was evil!)
