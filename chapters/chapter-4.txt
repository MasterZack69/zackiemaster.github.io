I was walking down a street, looking for a shop to buy some groceries.

𝐿𝑖𝑣, 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒.
6:30 PM

A week has passed since I found out that I and Liv has been infused with each other. 𝘓𝘪𝘷; Living in Virtuality, I named it just some days ago since calling it [Smart Eye] again and again was too long and............... stupid. 𝘓𝘪𝘷 and I have been trying to live a comfortable life together, not attracting much attention. For better or worse, having an AI assistant inside my body is really helpful. I do not even need a cellphone now, I can do all sorts of thing inside my brain, including spying on someone with 100x zoom.
Looks like it is using that high amount of electrical energy which is, God knows how, is present inside me. It doesn't seem to run out, like an endless source of energy. I haven't told 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 about 𝘓𝘪𝘷 yet. I just don't know what to say. 

Florida, a beautiful city full of natural beauty. In the time of evening, it is showered with brilliant and vibrant colors, getting reflected by both the crystal clear water and the skyscrapers. It has name in both the history and the present. Only an idiot wouldn't know about its existence.

ℎ𝑜𝑤 𝑚𝑢𝑐ℎ 𝑚𝑜𝑟𝑒?
"15 steps forward then left. Then 23 steps more."

Yes, I am using this fantastic creation for grocery.
After a minute, I reached the store and got inside it. It was neither much big nor small. The floor was really clean. There was an old man at the counter, He looked like that he was in mid 50s. Except that man, only 2 people were here. Well, who cares, I am just here for carrots and potatoes. I searched the shelves looking for the items I need.

ℎ𝑚𝑚........ 𝑠ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑑 𝐼 𝑔𝑒𝑡 𝑠𝑜𝑚𝑒 𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝑡𝑜𝑜........
A certainly deep thought.

*𝑏𝑎𝑛𝑔
The doors of the shop were opened so sudden like how a child would open his birthday gift.

"Give me all you have! Now!", said a man with a knife in his hand. 2 more people came inside following him. They were all wearing black mask. But could they complete the task? Enough with the rhyming, let's get serious. One of them came to me, asking for money. "Asking" would be a kind word, given the situation. This is going to be the best time when I am going to test the combat feature of 𝘓𝘪𝘷. I have been eagerly waiting for this!

I directly said to him,"I ain't got no money for you."

That guy became angry.

"What? Say it again, kid.", he said while showing his knife to me.

"Which part of ’I ain't got no money for you’ you do not understand, old fart?"

He raised his hand to attack at me. Then, suddenly it all froze and a familiar voice came inside my mind-

"Emergency Combat Protocol Activated" 

Blue visuals started to appear before my eyes. Telling me where to hit, how to hit. One of them told me to kick the guy directly in his stomach, compared to the other options, it looked way cooler. I used my right leg to kick him hard, very hard. But then- even if it was for a moment, I saw something strange. Spark. An electric spark on my leg. My kick sent that guy flying out of the shop, to the streets where he layed still. 
It was cool but I wonder what that spark was.

The guy who first barged the door threw his knife at me. Time was slow for me. I could've easily dodged it but what's the fun in that? I spinned myself and kicked the knife back in mid-air. The knife passed through just a little left from his ear, piercing half an inch into the wall. The sound of knife piercing is the wall echoed throughout the whole shop. That man was shunned. He and the others left in a hurry, picking the guy who I kicked out.

I had just became the local centre of attraction. Everyone's eyes were on me. 

The guy at the counter asked in surprise, "How..... did you do it?" 

"Ummm......... Kung Fu classes, I guess?" 
What else should I have said? That I am a cyborg?

"Thank you young man! My store is safe because of you. I knew there has been many reports of robery lately in this area. But I never thought it would come to this. Thank you again. How can I repay your kindness?" 

"It would be enough if you would just show me where the carrots and potatoes are."

"Just that much? Let me get them for you."

"That would be very kind of you."

He picked up a polythene bag and looked for what I asked. The combat mode of 𝘓𝘪𝘷 was working great. Well, it was made by me so it was expected.

𝐺𝑜𝑜𝑑 𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘, 𝑙𝑖𝑣.
"Thank You, Master."

If any of you is wondering about this "Master" thing, I reprogrammed 𝘓𝘪𝘷 to call me Master, not subject. This sounds weird but somehow I can just change the codes by thinking with my brain.

"Here you go, Young man.", the old man said.

"How much is it gonna cost?", I asked by reaching my wallet by my hand.

"Oh, nothing. It's on the house."

"You sure?"

"Yes. After all, you saved me and my shop from getting robbed."

"Thanks!"

I reached the door. I grabbed its handle to open it and then the old man asked-

"My name is 𝘉𝘪𝘭𝘭. What is yours?"

"Oh, it's 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹!"

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

𝐻𝑎𝑙𝑓 𝑎𝑛 ℎ𝑜𝑢𝑟 𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟,

"I'm home.", I said even though there was no one to welcome.

I put the items I bought (for free) at the table and sat on the chair.

𝐻𝑚𝑚......... 𝑤ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑤𝑜𝑢𝑙𝑑 𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑠𝑝𝑎𝑟𝑘 𝑏𝑒.

"𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘚𝘮𝘪𝘵𝘩 is calling."

𝑃𝑖𝑐𝑘 𝑖𝑡 𝑢𝑝

"Hey 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳, everything okay?"

"You tell. I heard that some masked guy attacked a shop where you were gone for shopping."

"Huh? This is news to me."

"Well, whatever. Sounds like you are fine. So did you try the carrot soup recipe I gave you?"

"Oh, I was just going to."

"Do tell me how delicious it is after you've tasted it."

"Yep, sure "

"Call has ended now." 

𝑂𝑘𝑎𝑦 𝑠𝑜, 𝐿𝑖𝑣, 𝑊ℎ𝑎𝑡 𝑤𝑎𝑠 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑝𝑒 𝑎𝑔𝑎𝑖𝑛?

"First take some carrots and potatoes, put them........."




(see? a completely normal life)
