A beautiful morning. A rise from the East, shone all of the West. Light rays illuminating the world, freeing it from the grasp of darkness. The orange shade working as a garnish on high class food.

I woke up, took a yawn, a long one. 

"Good Morning, Master."

𝑴𝒐𝒓𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈, 𝑳𝒊𝒗.

I reached my bathroom, picked up the toothbrush and put some toothpaste on it.

𝑩𝒓𝒖𝒔𝒉 𝒎𝒚 𝒕𝒆𝒆𝒕𝒉.

"Ok, Master."

My hands moved on their own. Not actually, I mean, 𝘓𝘪𝘷 was controlling them. I didn't even have to do anything now. 𝘓𝘪𝘷 did it all for me. Life has become so easy because of her.

After I comple-
I mean, after 𝘓𝘪𝘷 completed the brushing, I washed my face and got inside the kitchen. (who tf needs a bath)

I still had some carrot soupe left from yesterday. So, I got it out of the fridge and warmed it up. I put it in a bowl and had a sip.

𝑨𝒎𝒂𝒛𝒊𝒏𝒈.

Recipes recommended by 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 never disappointed me, not even once.

𝐿𝑖𝑣, 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒.
6:30 AM

𝑯𝒎𝒎, 𝑳𝒐𝒐𝒌𝒔 𝒍𝒊𝒌𝒆 𝒊𝒕'𝒔 𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒆 𝒕𝒐 𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝒇𝒐𝒓 𝒔𝒄𝒉𝒐𝒐𝒍.

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

The entrance was rather crowded. People coming from here and there. Very common actually. I was on a sick leave for a week since I got struck by lightning.

I walked through the corridor which was full of people. They were staring at me and whispering behind my back. They thought I couldn't listen.

"𝑾𝒂𝒔𝒏'𝒕 𝒉𝒆 𝒔𝒕𝒓𝒖𝒄𝒌 𝒃𝒚 𝒍𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈?"
"𝑯𝒐𝒘 𝒊𝒔 𝒉𝒆 𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒏 𝒂𝒍𝒊𝒗𝒆?"
"𝑰 𝒃𝒆𝒕 𝒏𝒐𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒉𝒂𝒑𝒑𝒆𝒏𝒆𝒅, 𝒉𝒆 𝒋𝒖𝒔𝒕 𝒘𝒂𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒅 𝒂𝒏 𝒆𝒙𝒄𝒖𝒔𝒆 𝒕𝒐 𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝒔𝒄𝒉𝒐𝒐𝒍."
"𝒀𝒆𝒂𝒉, 𝒔𝒎𝒂𝒓𝒕𝒂𝒔𝒔𝒆𝒔 𝒍𝒊𝒌𝒆 𝒉𝒊𝒎 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒌 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒚 𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒃𝒆𝒔𝒕. 𝑻𝒉𝒆𝒚 𝒅𝒐𝒏'𝒕 𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒏 𝒘𝒂𝒏𝒕 𝒕𝒐 𝒍𝒐𝒐𝒌 𝒂𝒕 𝒑𝒆𝒐𝒑𝒍𝒆 𝒍𝒊𝒌𝒆 𝒖𝒔."
"𝑮𝒐 𝒃𝒂𝒄𝒌 𝒕𝒐 𝒘𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒆 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒄𝒂𝒎𝒆 𝒇𝒓𝒐𝒎."

Without giving any reaction, I just continued on my path. I won't say that I ignored them. If not for the lightning strike that day, I would have left them already. They are literally too annoying. Lifeless people.

I reached my class, 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 was already there.
"Hey, 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹! So here you are."

"Yup, here I am."

"I missed you quite a lot, you know."

"It seems you are not the only one who missed me.", I said while looking around the faces which stared at me with eyes definitely not full of happiness.

"Ignore them. They are just jealous because the topper is back."

*𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑠

The school bell rang, telling that the classes are now going to start. Without wasting much time, Everyone seated on their place. Our Maths teacher, 𝘔𝘴. 𝘈𝘭𝘪𝘤𝘪𝘢 𝘕𝘰𝘳𝘵𝘩 came. She was born in England. Golden hair, blue eyes, she was a perfect European beauty. She could've been a model, I wonder what she is doing here. We all stood up from our seats and greeted her like usual.  

"Good morning, students, You can sit down."

She looked at me and said in suprise, "Ah! 𝘔𝘳. 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, you are finally back. Are you well?"

"Yes, I am well. Thanks for your concern." 
Hmph, finally someone is showing concern.

"Glad to hear it. So class, today I am going to write some questions on the board about what I taught you last week. Let's see who can solve them or who cannot."

She picked up the market from her desk and wrote a question on the board.
"Those who can solve it, raise your hand."

There were none. Except me.

"Huh? 𝘔𝘳. 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, are you sure you can do it? You weren't even here last week."

"I can, it looks easy to me."

"Well sure, then come here and try." 

"𝑯𝒖𝒉? 𝑬𝒗𝒆𝒏 𝒊𝒇 𝒉𝒆 𝒊𝒔 𝒂 𝒃𝒊𝒕 𝒔𝒎𝒂𝒓𝒕, 𝒊𝒕 𝒅𝒐𝒆𝒔𝒏'𝒕 𝒎𝒆𝒂𝒏 𝒉𝒆 𝒄𝒂𝒏 𝒔𝒐𝒍𝒗𝒆 𝒂 𝒒𝒖𝒆𝒔𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝒃𝒂𝒔𝒆𝒅 𝒐𝒏 𝒂 𝒕𝒐𝒑𝒊𝒄 𝒉𝒆 𝒅𝒐𝒆𝒔𝒏'𝒕 𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒏 𝒌𝒏𝒐𝒘 𝒂𝒃𝒐𝒖𝒕."
"𝑰𝒕'𝒔 𝒏𝒐𝒕 𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒏 𝒆𝒂𝒔𝒚, 𝒊𝒕 𝒊𝒔 𝒂 𝒄𝒐𝒎𝒑𝒍𝒆𝒙 𝒐𝒏𝒆."
"𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝒍𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒎𝒖𝒔𝒕 𝒉𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝒎𝒂𝒅𝒆 𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒔𝒄𝒓𝒆𝒘𝒔 𝒈𝒐 𝒍𝒐𝒐𝒔𝒆."

I picked up the marker from 𝘔𝘴. 𝘈𝘭𝘪𝘤𝘪𝘢's hands and grabbed it like a sword. I turned to the board and-

𝑳𝒊𝒗, 𝒔𝒉𝒐𝒘 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒎 𝒘𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒘𝒆 𝒈𝒐𝒕.

After a mere second,
"Calculation Completed. This a biquardratic equation. To solve it, first you need to......and then................then that.........."

My hands moved at near lightspeed. What seemed like a complex question, was actually in done in 1min and 48sec to be exact.

𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 looked at me with surprise and I gave back a smirk in exchange.

"𝑰𝒕'𝒔 𝒊𝒎𝒑𝒐𝒔𝒔𝒊𝒃𝒍𝒆!"
"𝑵-𝑵𝒐 𝒘𝒂𝒚!"
"𝑯𝒆 𝒎𝒖𝒔𝒕 𝒃𝒆 𝒄𝒉𝒆𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒔𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒉𝒐𝒘......"

"Marvelous! You all should learn from 𝘔𝘳. 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹. Even though he was absent, he successfully completed the equation in no time. Yet, you all come daily and still know nothing! You can go back to your seat, 𝘔𝘳. 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹."

I was going to give the marker back to 𝘔𝘴. 𝘈𝘭𝘪𝘤𝘪𝘢-

*𝒕𝒉𝒖𝒎𝒑 𝒕𝒉𝒖𝒎𝒑 𝒕𝒉𝒖𝒎𝒑 𝒕𝒉𝒖𝒎𝒑

My heartbeat............. just started racing. I felt a shiver on my right hand. The marker I was holding dropped down on the floor. The sound of it crashing on the floor pierced my ears. Everyone in the class became silent. 𝘔𝘴. 𝘈𝘭𝘪𝘤𝘪𝘢 decided to break this silence-

"Are you okay, 𝘔𝘳. 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹?"

"I am not feeling well........... can I use the restroom for a bit?"

"O-ok, sure."

"Thanks"

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

*𝒂𝒓𝒈𝒉
"Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, FUCK!"

My right hand was right in between the water tap and the basin. Water pouring from it, falling on my hand like a waterfall.

"𝘓𝘪𝘷! What the hell is happening to me!?"

"I'm sorry but this case is beyond my capabilities."

"fuck!"

My hand was glowing with severe burn. I could see sparks of electricity in my nerves, it was like my skin had almost become transparent. It was causing too much pain. The water I was pouring on it just vaporized.

"Here, you should use this."

It was an unknown but familiar voice. I looked around and saw her, 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 𝘔𝘢𝘳𝘵í𝘯𝘦𝘻. Her long snow white hair going down all the way to her skirt. She was always so calm. Her blue eyes, an ornament to her beautiful face. I could look at them all day-
Wait. Did I just complement her? My sworn enemy? Ah, whatever. It's not important. The thing which is important is that my hand is BURNING!!!!!!!!

"Huh? 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 𝘔𝘢𝘳𝘵í𝘯𝘦𝘻? what are you doing here?"

"We don't have time for questions and answers. Inject this in your hand."

She moved her right hand towards me, holding an injection. The injection had a mysterious green fluid inside it. Wait, could it be-

"Hey, What's that green substance?"

"I will tell you, but first inject it otherwise your whole body may face electrolysis."

"Wha-? Should have told me sooner!"

I took the injection from her hand and injected whatever was in their directly into my hand.
The injection was empty now. My hand started feeling better, second by second. The traces of burn vanished in a moment. My heart rate also became normal.

"Now, 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳 𝘞𝘪𝘭𝘭𝘪𝘢𝘮𝘴, I would require you to come to my lab. There, I will explain each and everything."

"Your lab?"

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

I followed 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 to her house. It was more like a Mansion. Security was full tight. Finally, we were inside the house. Servants were everywhere to be seen. They bowed before her as she walked past them. She took me to her basement.

"This basement is your lab?"

"No, my lab is there."

"There?"

"Come, let me show you."

 She walked towards the further end of her basement, touched the wall with her hand and bam- 

A door appeared. She inserted a key in its keyhole, then the door opened.

She looked at me and said, "What are waiting for? We don't have all day."

"Yes, yes." 

After she and I entered, the door automatically closed. The whole room lit up by God knows how many lights. The Lab looked like a big one, something which only big scientists have. There was every machinery to be found. Even a CT scanner!

I asked in surprise, "Since when 15 year olds started having this kind of lab?"

"Since I came to this world", She answered very calmingly.

Yes, I am jealous of her. You got any problem with that?

"Ok, so you were going to tell me something?"

"Yes, listen. This might sound crazy but we are dealing with Alien Invasion."

🤣 Man I literally laughed. 
"Alien invasion? seriously?"

Still laughing. She didn't seem to care much about that.

"Do you know about that green fluid?"

Now things were becoming serious, I stopped laughing. (but seriously alien invasion lmao 🤣🤣🤣)

"I do and at the same time, I don't."

"Well, it is a powerful chemical named Kezlar made by those aliens. Those aliens are called Valacyn, they look just like us humans. Their home planet Valacia is light years away from Milky Way. They conquer other planets to rob them off their resources. Countless galaxies have been ravaged by them."

"And they are coming to conquer Earth now?"

"Yes."

"Ok, ok. So, did you heard about this story on Facebook or Instagram?"

*𝑺𝒊𝒈𝒉

"At least pretend to be serious."

"Sorry, please continue your interesting story. It's an  8/10 by the way."

"Well, they made this chemical Kezlar so that they could make super soldiers, like the one you are now."

"What's super about me?"

"Your infusion with [Smart Eye] and lightning."

I raised my guard suddenly.

"I don't remember telling you anything about that."

Another familiar voice came from near, "Yep, you didn't tell her. I did."

I turned around and then-

"You! You are that doctor!"

My guard was even more high. Everything looked suspicious now. Have I been led to a trap?

"Yes, I am that doctor. My name is 𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 𝘚𝘰𝘶𝘭𝘦. I and 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 are working together to fight this invasion."

"Wait, wait, wait. This conversation isn't making any sense! Why are you both working together? How the hell did the Kezlar reach me? Even if we consider that alien invasion is correct, then how the hell are you going to fight something like a Galactic Empire!"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, take a breath. Don't interrupt, just listen. The Kezlar isn't perfectly made. When the Valacyns try to use them, they suffer a horrible death. Even if they get powers, they lose their mind."

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Since the DNA and Body Structure of Valacyns match 63% with humans. they have been experimenting on humans lately. 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 and I almost became their victim. They picked us up from the street and brought us into their facility where there were more people. Luckily, We escaped from them and unluckily, they are hunting us."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "They have even infiltrated the higher ranks of the government. No one can be trusted. If their project is successful, everyone will die. But you, 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, are the key. The key to save us all!"

"Oh, cool. But how?", I said without showing much concern.

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "You are the only one whose body didn't suffer much by Kezlar. The bonds are perfect. Not just that, you even have your [Smart Eye]. If trained, you will become practically unrivaled."

"So you want me to be a hero?"

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Not exactly but yeah. It's our only shot."

"Ok. So can you please tell me who the hell gave me Kezlar?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "It is still unknown."

"What do you mean by unknown?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Sorry, but I do not have the answer."

"Oh, then you should better find one because I am getting the hell out of here."
