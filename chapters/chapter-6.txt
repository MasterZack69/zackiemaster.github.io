"I am getting the hell out of here."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹! wait! If there is any chance that the Valacyns know about you, your life could be in danger! They will kill you!"

I told her with high confidence, "I would like to see them try."

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Let him go, he will come back. Just like he came to me when he was struck by lightning. Fate is in motion."
(what kind of a doctor talks like a saint?)

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

Weird people! Alien Invasion my ass! Who knows if they are the ones responsible for my condition.(which is really good actually)

𝑳𝒊𝒗, 𝒈𝒊𝒗𝒆 𝒎𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒔𝒉𝒐𝒓𝒕𝒆𝒔𝒕 𝒓𝒐𝒖𝒕𝒆 𝒕𝒐 𝒉𝒐𝒎𝒆.

"7 Steps forward, then right into the alley."

That 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 cannot be trusted in any sense! And that doctor charged me 60$ for that pot! I am not even hero material. Fighting a galactic empire alone is just pure stupidit-

"Emergency Combat Protocol Activated"

My body autmatically moved leftward reacting to the combat protocol, the trash can which was behind me was blown.

𝑳𝒊𝒗, 𝒘𝒉𝒂𝒕'𝒔 𝒉𝒂𝒑𝒑𝒆𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈?

"There seems to be sniper in a building 300m far in the righward direction. It seems to be that the sniper is using a laser rifle."

Another shot came, a normal person would have died twice but I am not one. I dodged again, getting inside one of the buildings of the alley.

𝑩𝒂𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒓𝒅 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒏𝒌𝒔 𝒉𝒆 𝒄𝒂𝒏 𝒋𝒖𝒔𝒕 𝒌𝒊𝒍𝒍 𝒎𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒆𝒂𝒔𝒊𝒍𝒚.

I climbed the stairs of the building, reaching the terrace.

𝑳𝒊𝒗, 𝒈𝒊𝒗𝒆 𝒎𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒅𝒊𝒓𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏.

"At your 2'O clock."

I ran in that direction, jumping from this building to another thanks to the narrowness of the alley.

Another shot came, another one was dodged. Another building came, another one was jumped.

In no time, the gap between the sniper and me disappeared, I got a look on him. He was wearing a pitch-black jacket, typical assassin costume. But this one himself was going to get assassinated. 

"Target is near."

He was getting himself packed, readying himself to escape. Looks like he finally knew who he was messing with. 

He was escaping and then I shouted, "You think you can just shoot at me and get away?"

He turned to gave me a look-

*𝒔𝒎𝒂𝒔𝒉 

A punch to his face smashed him down. But he didn't startle, instead he looked at me and gave a wide grin. He rose up and tried to gave me a punch back but sadly for him, I had 𝘓𝘪𝘷. I blocked his punch with my hands and kicked on his right leg. He lost balance and then I gave him an uppercut to his jaw.

*𝑻𝒉𝒖𝒅
He fell down. 
*𝒑𝒆𝒘

Something had hitten me from behind my neck. I touched there and found a dart. I looked around and saw- people, so many people, all wearing a purple colored uniform.

"I'm fucked."

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

*𝒈𝒂𝒔𝒑

I suddenly opened my eyes, catching breath. The first thing I saw was a man. I tried to get up but looked like I was on a stretcher, a futuristic one. Two Metallic belts binding me to it.

"Oh! Looks like you are awake."

"Umm...... who are you?"

"That doesn't matter. The thing which matters is 𝒘𝒉𝒐 𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝒚𝒐𝒖. "

"Stop with the riddles. Get me out of here and I will not break any bone in your body."

"My, my. You are quite a specimen. Both mentally and especially physically. The Kezlar have made such a  perfect bond with your cells. Even though I have been to many planets, I have never seen such perfect beauty."

𝑶𝒌, 𝒔𝒐 𝒉𝒆 𝒊𝒔 𝒂 𝒎𝒂𝒅 𝒔𝒄𝒊𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒊𝒔𝒕.

I asked in curiosity, "Wait, are you the one who made Kezlar?"

"Oh no no. You flatter me. I am just a humble scientist devoting himself to the glorious future of Valacia."

𝑽𝒂𝒍𝒂𝒄𝒊𝒂!? 𝑻𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒎𝒆𝒂𝒏𝒔 𝒕𝒉𝒐𝒔𝒆 𝒕𝒘𝒐 𝒘𝒆𝒓𝒆 𝒓𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕! 

"Quite humble of you to send people to hunt me."

"I apologize for that. It was just a test."

"Test?"

"I wanted to see if it's true that you have made the perfect bond with Kezlar. Your speed, strength all surpassed my expectations. The chemical which was in that dart was supposed to make a horse sleep for 3 days. Yet, here you are wide awake in just 3 hours."

"Cool, now can I go?"

"Absolutely not. I am going to examine you thoroughly. For starter, I would like to cut your hand off to see if it can regenerate."

*𝒔𝒊𝒈𝒉
"I don't have time for this play. Do you know about 𝘓𝘪𝘷?"

"𝘓𝘪𝘷? Who's that?"

"Well, if you knew who she is, you would have never made the mistake to trap me with this thing."

In a second- the Metallic belts were removed. I got on my feets.

"H-how? How did you do that?"

"It's just a little hacking, nothing else."

I gave that guy a headbutt. He fell on the floor, completely unconscious.

𝒉𝒎𝒑𝒉. 𝑳𝒊𝒗, 𝒘𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒆 𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝒘𝒆?

"Location Unknown. It seems that this place is using a signal jammer."

𝑾𝒆𝒍𝒍, 𝒍𝒐𝒐𝒌𝒔 𝒍𝒊𝒌𝒆 𝑰 𝒘𝒊𝒍𝒍 𝒋𝒖𝒔𝒕 𝒉𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝒕𝒐 𝒎𝒂𝒌𝒆 𝒊𝒕 𝒐𝒖𝒕.

I walked towards the door, opened it, finding three guards with big guns.

"Ah..... hello!"

They didn't seem to greet back. Instead, they pointed their guns to me-

"Hands on the floor!"

"Sorry, but that's not happening. See ya later!"

I jumped, high above, got past them. And then I punched? No. I ran for my life, fighting them head-on was a little risky. It was a maze of corridors. Then- the whole place lit up with red color and weird sound started to came. This meant one thing- those guards have raised the alarm. 

𝑺𝒉𝒊𝒕! 𝑰 𝒎𝒂𝒅𝒆 𝒂 𝒎𝒊𝒔𝒕𝒂𝒌𝒆!

*𝒑𝒆𝒘

"Aaah! Shit!"

A laser hit my right leg, I fell down to my knees. It had made a hole, blood was flowing through it. More and more guards started to around me. Dozens of them.

𝑭𝒖𝒄𝒌! 𝑰 𝒄𝒂𝒏𝒏𝒐𝒕 𝒋𝒖𝒔𝒕 𝒅𝒊𝒆 𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒆!

One of them came to me with cuffs in his hand. He touched me and-

*𝒂𝒓𝒈𝒉

He....... he cried in pain. Then suddenly a blue aura containing lightning sparks appeared around me! My wound healed in a second. 

"𝑾𝒉-𝒘𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒊𝒔 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒔!"
"𝑰𝒕'𝒔....... 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒌𝒆𝒛𝒍𝒂𝒓!"
"𝑯𝒖𝒉? 𝒅𝒐𝒏'𝒕 𝒕𝒆𝒍𝒍 𝒎𝒆 𝒉𝒆 𝒉𝒂𝒔 𝒅𝒐𝒏𝒆 𝒊𝒕!"

The guards started murmuring. But I............ I felt a surge of energy.

"Who is ready to die?"

Getting back to the situation, they all pointed their guns at me.

"FIRE!"

All of them fired at the same time. But they didn't know who they were firing at. I, dodging all of the lasers, brought down the guards second by second. Some getting a punch, some getting a kick. Each getting knocked by just one hit. I was very fast and flexible with my movements. It was impossible to even aim at me, let alone hit.

*𝒕𝒉𝒖𝒅 

The last guard had fallen.

"Ah! What a sense of relief!"

I relaxed myself a bit. The blue aura automatically disappeared.

𝑳𝒊𝒗, 𝒘𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒘𝒂𝒔 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕?

"It seems that the electrical energy inside you came out for a moment."

I had now another mystery to solve. But first, I had to get the hell out of this place. I walked forward. I found an elevator! I ran towards it- 

"Hello? Anyone there?" 

This voice came from a room near to me. I decided to check on it. I got inside. There was a big screen, a young man's face on it.

"Finally someone came! Do you know how long I have waited? I could punish you to death."

"Sorry, who are you again?"

"Wha-? How dare you ask my identity, you commoner! I, Emperor Rydian Velazador Valacia III, do hereby sentence you to death."

𝑶𝒉, 𝒔𝒐 𝒉𝒆 𝒊𝒔 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒊𝒓 𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒅𝒆𝒓.....

"Oh wow, I am so scared. 😨"

"How dare you! Consider yourself lucky that I am not on Earth otherwise you would have already died thrice!"

*𝒔𝒊𝒈𝒉 
"Listen, you fool. I am not your stupid henchman. I am 𝑨𝒍𝒆𝒙𝒂𝒏𝒅𝒆𝒓 𝑾𝒊𝒍𝒍𝒊𝒂𝒎𝒔, the human who defeated all your soldiers of this facility. You lowly theives aren't going to steal anything from my planet. I didn't mind much at the start, but you attacked me. I am going to give you the worst kind of death ever possible. I hereby declare war with you."
