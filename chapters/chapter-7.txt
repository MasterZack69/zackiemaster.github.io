Yesterday was a rough one. I decided to help those two faggots out of my generousity. 

"Hey, 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦! Let's go to your house. We got something to talk."

She looked at me with surprise, not just she, her whole classroom in which I shouted.

"𝑾𝑯𝑨𝑻!?"
"𝑰𝒔𝒏'𝒕 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒈𝒖𝒚 𝑨𝒍𝒆𝒙𝒂𝒏𝒅𝒆𝒓 𝒇𝒓𝒐𝒎 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒐𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒓 𝒄𝒍𝒂𝒔𝒔?"
"𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕'𝒔 𝒉𝒂𝒑𝒑𝒆𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈!?"

"Ok let's go."

"𝑺𝒉𝒆 𝒂𝒈𝒓𝒆𝒆𝒅!?"
"𝑻𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒊𝒔 𝒊𝒎𝒑𝒐𝒔𝒔𝒊𝒃𝒍𝒆!"
"𝑾𝒆𝒓𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒔𝒆 𝒕𝒘𝒐 𝒂𝒍𝒘𝒂𝒚𝒔 𝒔𝒐 𝒄𝒍𝒐𝒔𝒆?"

We walked through the corridor "together". 

"Is 𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 there?"

"Yes."

"𝑨𝒓𝒆𝒏'𝒕 𝒕𝒉𝒐𝒔𝒆 𝒕𝒘𝒐 𝑹𝒐𝒔𝒆 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑨𝒍𝒆𝒙?"
"𝑰 𝒕𝒉𝒐𝒖𝒈𝒉𝒕 𝑨𝒍𝒆𝒙 𝒅𝒊𝒅𝒏'𝒕 𝒍𝒊𝒌𝒆 𝒉𝒆𝒓...."
"𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒚 𝒅𝒐𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒕𝒐𝒈𝒆𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒓?"

Suddenly, a familiar voice came- "𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹! You all right? You didn't look well yesterday and then you left without saying anything."

Then suddenly his sight fell on 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦.

"Hey! Aren't you 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦? What are you two doing together?"

"First, I am completely fine. Second, Yes, She is 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦. She and I are going to study together."

"W-what? When did this happen?"

"It's a long story. I will tell you later. Come, 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦. Let's get going."

"Wait! 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹! NOT AGAIN!"

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "YOU DID WHAT!?"

"I declared war?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Are you out of your mind!?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 who was always so calm, finally reached her limit. It was actually really funny to see her in such state.

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "You are going to get us all killed!"

"First, fighting against a galactic empire was going to get us all killed from the start. Second, weren't we already going to do war with them sooner or later?"

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "We lost our element of surprise because of you. You literally gave a life threat to the Emperor of Valacia. They must be on high alert by now."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Looks like we do not have much choice now. We have to train 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹 to get him stronger."

"Stronger? I am already strong."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "You aren't. They have got many with powers. They aren't in their right mind and don't have perfect bonds like you have but they are large in number. The state in which you are now will get you dead in just a day."

"Ok so, what to do next?"

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 took us to an old building, It looked like a factory which was desserted thousands of years ago. She told us that it was a 𝘔𝘢𝘳𝘵í𝘯𝘦𝘻 property and we can use it without any problem. No one will ever even come here, as long as I don't do anything rash. After that, she left. She had some work to do in school. I and 𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 were left alone. 𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 had short dark brown hairs, pale skin, and brown eyes. To be honest, I didn't like this guy much. He took my 60$!!!

"Ok so, 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, you told me that electricity appeared around you, right?"

"Yes."

"So looks like your powers are lightning based."

He pointed his finger toward a pillar-

"Shoot lightning at it."

"Wha-? How?"

"Try to raise your hands towards it and think like shooting."

"Just that?"

"Yes. Just that."

I did as I was told. Nothing happened.

"It's not working."

"Hmm............ expected."

"Expected?"

He picked up a brick and threw at me-

"Now, Shoot!"

Wha-

*𝒛𝒂𝒑

The brick fell to the ground. Or what was left of it. 

"What happened?"

"Hmm....... looks like you don't have much control over your power. They only come when you are in danger. Ok now, try to fly."

"Wait, that's too much. Why do you think I can even fly?"

"I don't. We will just have to find out by dropping you off this building. If you can fly, you will be safe. If you cannot, you will heal quickly. Moreover, flying will be a very good advantage against your enemies. The Valacyns don't have just ground soldiers, they have spaceships too. It's only 3 floors. Jump."

"No, no, no. I don't think if it's a good idea. Let's just try the shooting."

He looked at me with serious eyes and said, "I'm serious. Jump."

"Ok, Dr. Devil. Here I go."

Closing my eyes, I jumped off the building.
𝑷𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒔𝒆, 𝒑𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒔𝒆, 𝒑𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒔𝒆, 𝒑𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒔𝒆.

*𝒕𝒉𝒖𝒅
*𝒂𝒓𝒈𝒉

"𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹! You ok?"

"WHAT DO YOU THINK, YOU BASTARD!!!!! FUUUUCK!!"

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Why the hell did you do that? I shouldn't have left you two alone."

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "We do not have much time. If he doesn't learn fast, we will die fast."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 :  "It doesn't mean you can just throw him off a building!"

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "The Valacyns will throw him to the space or a volcano. Compared to that, a 3-floor building is nothing."

I was laying on a stretcher, listening to those two's quarrel.
"You guys done? If I can heal fast, it doesn't mean you can just ignore a patient."

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "You kids do not understand a thing! My life was so good until the Valacyns came. They even know my identity, I cannot go to my home, not even the hospital. I am just stuck here in your pretty lab where my only hope cannot get his shit together!"

He left in anger.

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Don't mind him too much. He is just....... having a hard time."

"So am I. When I look back, I do think I probably made a mistake challenging the emperor. I wonder how I am going to beat him in this state........."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Do not overthink. You cannot just become strong overnight, it takes time."

"Can't I take some more of the Kezlar?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "We do not have any. The little we had was used to stabilize you. We do not even know if taking it would be safe."

"Hmm........ Looks like I and 𝘓𝘪𝘷 will have to do this alone for now."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "𝘓𝘪𝘷?"

"Oh yea, I haven't told you yet. Her name is 𝘓𝘪𝘷, my [Smart Eye]."

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

After having a little chit chat with my sworn enemy, I left. 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 warned me that I could get into a fight again. But I told her-

"C'mon, what are the odds of losing to some stupid soldiers twice. They could have just blown my home when I was sleeping there after I destroyed their facility. But they didn't, because they simply cannot. I have instilled fear into them."

I came to this seaside. During the time of sunset, it looked more beautiful than a British Princess. It was a place where I could get peace. No people in at least a km. Only trees, long and broad trees. I laid down there, doing nothing.

𝑳𝒊𝒗, 𝒕𝒆𝒍𝒍 𝒎𝒆 𝒂 𝒋𝒐𝒌𝒆.
"Get yourself a humour first."

𝑻𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒘𝒂𝒔 𝒂 𝒓𝒖𝒅𝒆 𝒐𝒏𝒆.
"You programmed me to talk like this."

Even she made a joke out of me. Life seemed very boring. Nothing to do. I could practically solve every academic questions now, so no need to study. I wish I could fight the Valacyns again, but even they were too weak for me now. I wonder what I will be left to do when I have beaten the shit out of that emperor. 

"Danger Near."

𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕? 𝑳𝒊𝒗?

"There seems to be someone near. Someone strong, overflowing with energy."
