There was a beeeeeeeeeeeg throne room. 50 times the size of my whole appartment. There was a guy sitting on the throne, Emperor Rydian Velazador etc. etc. (seriously the name is too big)
2 Guards were around him. One on the left, one on the right. A person was standing in front of him, in a distance of not more than 15m. He wore a lime green suit, with a mask of same color. The masked looked like a face of a Japanese demon, but futuristic. 

"HOW DARE HE INSULT ME LIKE THAT!!!!!"

"Calm down, Your Majesty. Commoners like him just know how to brag. They cannot even fathom the luxury you have."

"I want his head!"

"And you will receive it soon, but not now. That human has made perfect bonds with Kezlar. If we do anything rash, we will lose a great potential military weapon. I would like to study him first."

"Hmph, have it your way. Once you are done with him, finish him."

"Thank you, Your Majesty."

"Remember 𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘻𝘭𝘢𝘳, you are receiving this special treatment all because of your project. If it doesn't bear fruit, you will soon die along that human."

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

"There seems to be someone near. Someone strong, overflowing with energy."

𝑰𝒔 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒂 𝑽𝒂𝒍𝒂𝒄𝒚𝒏?

"Unable to identify."

I stood up, getting myself in a position to defend. Suddenly, the water in front me started to flow upwards, then it flew rightwards, then in circular way, and then slowly, slowy, it was personified. It looked like a Woman. Though, the body was still water.

"Hello. You must be 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, the fool who challenged the Emperor."

"Since when water started talking?"

"Since an AI merged with a pesky little human."

𝑺𝒉𝒊𝒕! 𝑺𝒉𝒆 𝒌𝒏𝒐𝒘𝒔 𝒂𝒃𝒐𝒖𝒕 𝑳𝒊𝒗.

 "Why don't you just sit down and enjoy the view with me? I could enjoy your company."

"You are quite a little flirter, but you chose the wrong person to flirt with. Looks like I will have to teach you some manners myself."

"Do try."

I jumped on her, landing a kick- or so I thought. My leg got stuck in her liquid body. 

"You really think something like this is enough to beat me?"

A water whipped appeared.

"Wh-what is that?"

 It swirled around my neck, becoming tight. It took me a distance away from her. 

"Let me tell you the full extent of Kezlar."

"S-stof."

I couldn't say the words clearly, the whip was too tight. Breathing was becoming impossible. Suddenly, with full force, the whip threw me to shoreside. I crashed in a tree, which fell down by the impact. Poor tree.

*𝒂𝒓𝒈𝒉

I moaned in pain. Well, a normal person would have been smashed to bits. I laid down, having no power to fight back. The difference between us was clear. She was leagues above me.
She came in front of me-

"My name is 𝘕𝘦𝘳𝘰𝘷𝘢𝘯𝘯. I am letting you live now because 𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘻𝘭𝘢𝘳 expects great things from you. Remember my name, we are bound to meet again."

She jumped off to the sea and disappeared. More like dissolved into it.

𝑳𝒊𝒗, 𝒄𝒂𝒏 𝒚𝒐𝒖 𝒔𝒆𝒏𝒔𝒆 𝒉𝒆𝒓.

"She is nowhere to be found."

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Hmm...... so a water woman attacked you."

"Yes."

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Like a wiggly twiggly water woman."

"Yes, a wiggly twiggly water woman."

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "And that water woman dissolved into water?"

"Yep, that's what happened. And what is with this water woman? She has a name."

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Why do you bother with that? You got a crush on her or something."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Can we concentrate on the task at hand?"

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Well, luckily, electricity has got an advantage against water. Unluckily, our hero cannot control them."

"And super unluckily, our hero is stuck with someone who throws him off a building."

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "You jumped on your own free will. That's not on me."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Please, you two. So 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, that water woman told you-"

"Not you too! Her name is 𝘕𝘦𝘳𝘰𝘷𝘢𝘯𝘯. The author put some effort in naming her, even more effort than naming me. Show him some respect!"

*𝒔𝒊𝒈𝒉
𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Ok so, 𝘕𝘦𝘳𝘰𝘷𝘢𝘯𝘯 told you about someone named 𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘻𝘭𝘢𝘳, right?"

"Right."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Looks like he is the guy who invented Kezlar."

"Even an idiot would know that by now. Tell something we don't know."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Well, we have to find out why this 𝘕𝘦𝘳𝘰𝘷𝘢𝘯𝘯 let you go. Wait. Did she do that so you could led her directly to our base?"

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "If that was the case, we would not be having this conversation." 

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "You think they are observing us?"

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 "Why would they even bother with that?"

"This is not going to lead us anywhere. I will just have to work on myself. By the way, 𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯, when I was in danger in that fight, in which I could've died easily, why didn't my powers come to save me?"

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "How would I know? I am not an expert on alien technology."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, I think you should go home. We will talk about this later."

"Huh? What if she attacks me again?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "She didn't let you live just because she could kill you half an hour later. You will be fine. 𝘓𝘪𝘷 should be able to keep you safe from the other threats."

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "𝘓𝘪𝘷? Who's that? We got a new member on our already-unstable team?"

"𝘓𝘪𝘷 is the name of my [Smart Eye]"

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Oh, so you have the time to lay down on a shore near sea and name things. Yet you do not train yourself?"

"You got a problem with that?"

I looked him directly into his eyes, and he did too.

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, go."

"Ok, whatever."

Night, a beautiful time to see a beautiful city. The lights were so bright even when the world was in darkness. I was just walking towards my home.

𝑯𝒎𝒑𝒉, 𝑰 𝒘𝒊𝒍𝒍 𝒌𝒊𝒍𝒍 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒅𝒐𝒄𝒕𝒐𝒓 𝒃𝒆𝒇𝒐𝒓𝒆 𝑰 𝒌𝒊𝒍𝒍 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒔𝒕𝒖𝒑𝒊𝒅 𝒆𝒎𝒑𝒆𝒓𝒐𝒓.

"𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹!"

This voice........

"𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳? What are you doing here?"

"I could ask you the same. You are usually the type to stay all alone in your home."

"Well, I was just heading there."

"From where? The grocery?"

"No....... from her house."

"From whose house?"

"From 𝒉𝒆𝒓 house."

"Who is this 𝒉𝒆𝒓?"

I looked at him with deadly eyes.

"You know who."

"Yea, but I want to hear it from you."

*𝒔𝒊𝒈𝒉
"I'm coming from 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦's house."

*𝒍𝒂𝒖𝒈𝒉𝒔

"I can't believe!", he said while laughing.

"What's funny in that?"

"You coming home this late from the house of that person who was your sworn enemy not so long ago."

"There is nothing between us. Not what you think."

"Then what is it? tell me, tell me."

"I can't. It's a secret."

"C'mon, 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹. Admit it yourself, you are interested in her."

"No way in hell something like that is going to happen!"

"But it is happening."

"It is not."

"It is."

"NO!", I shouted, yes, on the street.

"Ok, we will see. I gotta go home otherwise my mom will kill me. See you tomorrow."

𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳 left for his home and so did I. Man, I missed such conversation. It is true these powers have been a great help to me, but it feels like they are also isolating me from others, from 𝘖𝘭𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘳, from my life. Solving problems on my own were fun in their own way, but now I had became dependent on 𝘓𝘪𝘷.

I reached my appartment. I got inside and sat on my chair.

*𝒚𝒂𝒘𝒏

So much happened today. Me falling from a building, getting crashed into a tree. I was powerless all that time.................

My sight suddenly dropped on my table, there was a something on it, a note.

𝑾𝒉𝒐 𝒘𝒐𝒖𝒍𝒅 𝒍𝒆𝒂𝒗𝒆 𝒂 𝒏𝒐𝒕𝒆 𝒇𝒐𝒓 𝒎𝒆........

I picked it up, it said-

"Come back to the shore, otherwise I will blow off this whole building. If you tell anyone, everyone will die."

𝑾𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒉𝒆𝒍𝒍?

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

I came to the shore where I was badly beaten. Thanks to the moonlight, everything was visible even at night.  I looked to the sea and said-

"𝘕𝘦𝘳𝘰𝘷𝘢𝘯𝘯? You here? Instead of fighting, we can have coffee together. By the way, can you even drink coffee with that body of yours? If not, we can just drink water."

I walked a few steps forward, cautiously. Seeing left, right, everywhere. 

"C'mon, if you want a fight, just come. Don't waste my time, I have to sleep too. Do you aliens also sleep?"

*𝒕𝒉𝒖𝒅

Someone jumped right in front of me from God knows where. He wore a heavy metallic armor and a mask too. It looked like a face of a Japanese demon, but futuristic. Fully blue-colored. His eyes were also lit blue, rectangular shaped.

"Hello? Namaste? Konichiwa? Ni hao? Hola?" 

(Yes, I am flexing my language skills)

He didn't gave a reply. Just stood in front of me, with complete silence.

𝑳𝒊𝒗, 𝒘𝒉𝒐 𝒊𝒔 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒔?

"I cannot completely identify, but it shows no sign of life. The metal it's armor is made up of is not from Earth."

𝑨 𝒓𝒐𝒃𝒐𝒕?

"Probably, yes."

*𝒕𝒉𝒖𝒅

A sound came from my behind, 2 more like this robot appeared behind, in a distance of 20m, One in slightly left, one in slightly right.

𝑯𝒎𝒑𝒉, 𝒔𝒕𝒖𝒑𝒊𝒅𝒔. 𝑳𝒊𝒗, 𝒉𝒂𝒄𝒌 𝒊𝒏𝒕𝒐 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒎.

"Hacking failed."

𝑾𝒉𝒂-
*𝒔𝒎𝒂𝒔𝒉

The robot which was in front me gave me a strong hit with his punch. 

*𝒂𝒓𝒈𝒉

"That hurts........... you will pay."

I moved my leg, trying to give him a kick.

"Master, don-"

It was too late to warn.

*𝒂𝒓𝒈𝒉

"Ah fuck! My leg!"

The body of this robot was tough as hell, and of course it should be, it's made up of alien metal. What an idiot I am! I dropped down, leaving myself completely vulnerable and of course, they are robots, not human. They don't have pride.

*𝒔𝒎𝒂𝒔𝒉 *𝒔𝒎𝒂𝒔𝒉 *𝒔𝒎𝒂𝒔𝒉

The ones who were behind gave me a beating too. They were fast for someone so heavy, I couldn't not dodge them, counter attack was not even an option, I would just get myself hurt. It's like I was fighting with the stronger and smarter versions of 𝘓𝘪𝘷.

𝑳𝑰𝑽! 𝑴𝒐𝒗𝒆 𝒎𝒚 𝒈𝒐𝒅𝒅𝒂𝒎𝒏 𝒃𝒐𝒅𝒚. 𝑰 𝒅𝒐𝒏'𝒕 𝒄𝒂𝒓𝒆 𝒘𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒉𝒂𝒑𝒑𝒆𝒏𝒔.

She did what she was told. I got away from them, not so far, but safe for a little time. I coughed up blood, a lot of it.

"You have got 2 broken ribs. The bone in your right leg is also damaged."

𝑪𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝑹𝒐𝒔𝒆.

"Calling............ There seems to be a signal jammer here."

𝑭𝒖𝒄𝒌!

*𝒑𝒆𝒘

One of them shot a laser bolt, using his hand which was turned into a blaster. Luckily, I was able to dodge it.

"What next are you gonna do? Bring swords?"

*𝒔𝒎𝒂𝒔𝒉

A strong hit to my head came from behind I looked back- There was another one of them.

𝑵𝒐𝒘 𝒊𝒕'𝒔 4 𝒐𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒎? 𝑮𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒕.

The hit made my head bleed.

"Master, there is a crack in your skull. You immediately need medical attention."

That one grabbed my neck with his hand. My feets no longer touched the ground. I tried to fight back but it was futile.

𝑭𝒖𝒄𝒌, 𝒏𝒐𝒕 𝒍𝒊𝒌𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒔. 𝑻𝒉𝒆 𝒉𝒆𝒍𝒍 𝑰 𝒅𝒊𝒅 𝒕𝒐 𝒅𝒆𝒔𝒆𝒓𝒗𝒆 𝒂 𝒅𝒆𝒂𝒕𝒉 𝒍𝒊𝒌𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒔, 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒉𝒆𝒍𝒍 𝒎𝒚 𝒑𝒂𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒕𝒔 𝒅𝒊𝒅 𝒕𝒐 𝒅𝒊𝒆 𝒊𝒏 𝒂 𝒑𝒍𝒂𝒏𝒆 𝒄𝒓𝒂𝒔𝒉.
