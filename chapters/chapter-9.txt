*𝑳𝒊𝒈𝒉𝒕𝒏𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝑺𝒕𝒓𝒊𝒌𝒆

A lightning strike came from the sky, falling down on 2 people. One of them was me, and one of them was my hunter. Electricity inside me was released, becoming a vast and powerful aura. So bright that it could make anyone blind. The hand of the hunter became molten lava. The others looked at each other with confusion, unable to process what happened.

*𝒛𝒂𝒑

My right hand, showing sparks of electricity, was pointed towards an empty space where once a head-of-someone or something was.

*𝒕𝒉𝒖𝒅

The sound of a complete metallic body falling on the ground was breathtaking. But my feet was still above the ground. I was floating.

𝑳𝒊𝒗, 𝒍𝒆𝒕'𝒔 𝒑𝒂𝒚 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒎 𝒃𝒂𝒄𝒌.
"Sure, Master."

I looked towards the other three, they all were staring at me. I moved forward. I never felt this better in my whole life. Not even when I was in that Valacyn Facility. This time, it was different. I was not just overflowing with energy. I was one with energy.

*𝒑𝒆𝒘 𝒑𝒆𝒘 𝒑𝒆𝒘

All three started firing at me. I could've easily dodged them, but I didn't need to. I moved forward. The laser bolts just disappeared when they came in contact with my aura. I raised my right hand towards the one in the middle-

*𝒛𝒂𝒑

Lightning came from my hand, piercing right through that one's stomach, making a big hole.

𝑻𝒘𝒐 𝒍𝒆𝒇𝒕.

Finally, I landed. Those two who were left came running to me. One of them tried to punch me but I dodged it. Other one tried to kick me, but I dodged it again. 𝘓𝘪𝘷 was predicting their each and every single move with speed equivalence of a Quantum Computer. I moved my leg and- 

*𝒛𝒂𝒑

My lightning kick shattered the head of the one which was attacking me from the left.

*𝒕𝒉𝒖𝒅

The last one tried to punch me but I simply grabbed his hand and ripped it off. It gave me an other-worldly satisfaction. He was still standing........ but not for so long. I gave him an axe kick, which splitted his body in 2 pieces. 

*𝒕𝒉𝒖𝒅

All of them were fallen now........... including me.

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

Everything was dark. No light.

"𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹? You alive?"

Hearing a familiar manly voice, I slowly opened my eyes. I was lying still on a bed, which was definitely not the first time.

"𝘋𝘳.....................𝘏𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯?"

"𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯, yes."

"Oh.............. wait. I was there! I was there! What happened?"

"After some you left for your home, 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 tried to call you to check if you are okay. But the call never reached you. We thought you were in danger, so we quickly hurried to your appartment. There was a note in there, telling you to come to the infamous place which got you beaten like a fly."

"You could've said that in a beautiful tone, you know."

"After we reached the shore, we found you there lying, along with 4 dangerous looking robots. We brought you and them- or what was left of them to our lab where you currently just lying around listening to my story."

"Oh........ I see. So that's what happened. Wait, does it mean that they are here? That maybe dangerous!"

"Don't worry, 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 checked them. They are fine. No bugs or anything. Oh and by the way, the only one's head you didn't crush is right there."

He pointed his finger to the place directly in front of my bed.

I exclaimed,"What the hell! Why did you put that head right in front of me?"

"𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 is the one who put it there. Don't blame me."

"Where is she?"

"She is got school to attend to. Not everyone has time to lay around doing nothing."

𝑰 𝒘𝒂𝒔 𝒑𝒓𝒂𝒚𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒇𝒐𝒓 𝒕𝒉𝒆 𝒔𝒂𝒇𝒆𝒕𝒚 𝒐𝒇 𝒕𝒉𝒊𝒔 𝒅𝒊𝒄𝒌𝒉𝒆𝒂𝒅?

"Whatever, I would take a look at these wanna-be-killer robos."

I walked out of the bed, going in front of that head.

"You sure you don't need rest?"

"Nah, I'm great."

𝑯𝒎𝒑𝒉, 𝒔𝒂𝒚𝒊𝒏𝒈 𝒂𝒏𝒂𝒍𝒚𝒛𝒆 𝒋𝒖𝒔𝒕 𝒍𝒊𝒌𝒆 𝒕𝒉𝒂𝒕 𝒘𝒐𝒏'𝒕 𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒌.

I looked toward 𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 and said, "I will go out for a bit. Just for a second."

◀•••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••▶

After 5 minutes,

"I'm back."

"What? You are really early, where were you gone?"

"To the Valacyn Facility I destroyed."

"Wha-? That was dangerous. Why the hell did you go there, and I don't think it's so near that you can come and go in 5 minutes."

"Flying made it fast."

"WHAT!? YOU CAN FLY!?"

"Yeah."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "I'm back. Are you two fighting again?"

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Hey 𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦, 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹 just flew to that abandoned Valacyn Facility!"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Flew?"

"Yeah, it seems that I can control the electricity inside me now.", I told her by showing showing sparks on my fingers."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Wow 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹! That's amazing!"

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "What's amazing in that??????? What if someone saw him flying."

"Oh yeah, that's a problem."

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Don't worry about that. I knew something like this would definitely happen in near future so I designed a suit for you which would make you anonymous."

"A suit? Really? Thanks!"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Well, it isn't finished. It will take some time."

"Doesn't matter. Thanks again."

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Ahem. So 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹, you mind telling me why did you go back there?"

"Oh yea. Well, I opened one of their computers searching for alien data. And luckily it was there and now 𝘓𝘪𝘷 has it all."

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Ok so next?"

I looked toward a speaker in the lab-
"Now, 𝘓𝘪𝘷 connect yourself to that speaker."

"Done.", the voice came from the speaker.

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Woah, was that 𝘓𝘪𝘷?"

𝘓𝘪𝘷 : "Yes, it's me."

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "This is........ weird."

"Now we got every information we need. 𝘓𝘪𝘷, Analyze that robot."

𝘓𝘪𝘷 : "Analysis Completed. Object seems to be a Kezrin; invented by 𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘻𝘭𝘢𝘳. They are made up of Stacirium, a rare element found only in the Stacirian Planetary System which was invaded by the Valacian Empire. Stacirium is light weight, heat resistant, laser proof. Kezrin are special droids used for guarding the Valacian Palace and hunting down dangerous criminals."

𝑶𝒌, 𝒔𝒐 𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒚 𝒊𝒏𝒗𝒂𝒅𝒆 𝒎𝒚 𝒘𝒐𝒓𝒍𝒅 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝒄𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝒎𝒆 𝒂 𝒄𝒓𝒊𝒎𝒊𝒏𝒂𝒍.

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘻𝘭𝘢𝘳......... his name came up again. 𝘓𝘪𝘷, who is he?"

𝘓𝘪𝘷 : "𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘻𝘭𝘢𝘳 is the most famous scientist of the Valacian Empire. He has made many world-changing inventions such as Kezlar and Kezrin. He is currently the Head of the Kezlar Experiments on Earth."

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "Since when this Kezlar Experiment has been going on Earth?"

𝘓𝘪𝘷 : "Since 1923"

"What the hell? Then what's the age of 𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘻𝘭𝘢𝘳?"

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "That's such a long time. How many people have become victim to them?"

𝘓𝘪𝘷 : "𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘻𝘭𝘢𝘳 is currently 229 years old. Valacyns have an average life span of 300 years. As per 2023 May, 2700 humans have become victim by the Kezlar Experiments. Out of them only 1 has survived; 𝘈𝘭𝘦𝘹𝘢𝘯𝘥𝘦𝘳 𝘞𝘪𝘭𝘭𝘪𝘢𝘮𝘴."

"Wait I was part of that experiment? How?"

𝘓𝘪𝘷 : "No data available on that."

"Who is 𝘕𝘦𝘳𝘰𝘷𝘢𝘯𝘯?" 

𝘓𝘪𝘷 : "No data on her."

𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘷𝘪𝘯 : "What?"

𝘙𝘰𝘴𝘦 : "Why isn't she mentioned in any of the Valacian database?"

"𝘓𝘪𝘷, do you know about the whereabouts of the other Valacian Facilities?"

"Yes, Master."

"Do you know where 𝘋𝘳. 𝘒𝘦𝘻𝘭𝘢𝘳 is?"

"No, his whereabouts are unknown."

"Ok, Let's hunt all of the facilities one by one."
