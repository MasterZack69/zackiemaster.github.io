			<p style="font-size: larger;"><b>MasterZack's personally curated choice for groups</b></p>
			
				<p>∽ FraMeSToR, KRaLiMaRKo, WiLDCAT, EPSiLON, CiNEPHiLES, BLURANiUM (for remux) </p>
				<p>∽ ZoroSenpai, LoRD, CtrlHD, HiDT, DON (for bluray encodes)</p>
				<p>∽ WiKi (for asian stuff)</p>
				<p>∽ FLUX, HONE, Ntb, Kitsune, ShiNobi (for webdl, mostly all webdl are same because they are just downloads of a stream, but depending on device, country or luck sometimes the quality of the stream received differs and depending upon the release group, metadata differs too)</p>
				<p>∽ MA > AMZN > DSNP > iTunes > NF > HMAX (ott streams ranked in order. iTunes through Apple TV is the best but that stream cannot be captured. Netflix does better encoding on its exclusive content so even at low bitrate they will rival Amazon. otts which are not mentioned here have shit quality)</p>
				<p>∽ edge2020, iVy, QxR (storage friendly)</p>
